            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Horror, in ſteed of light, made there her abode, neither did any other comfortable Beame of pleaſure ſhine there, then ſuch as ioyleſſe ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines draweth from pining ſorrow. No cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sunne in this place vſed to caſt forth his gladſome raies, it being the ordinarie abiding of the blacke daughters of fatall death. The chiefeſt riches, the poore Shepheard found there, was Buſhes, Thornes, Brambles, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hard flintie Rocks, and huge ſenſeleſſe ſtones. No other creatures entertained he for his Gueſts, but brute Beaſtes, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe from the companie of men, as if they had bin diuels. Thouſands of Rocks, of which, ſome being eaten with time, other ſome blaſted with lightning, and ſome ſet out with ſharpe pointed Thornes, kept him as a Bulwarke, ſafe on the one ſide, and the periurde waters of the changing Sea, growing white with ſtormie Billows, preſeru'd him ſecure on the other. There ſometimes was the melancolike abode of ſtill ſleepe, there the reſting place of pale death, and there the lodge of ſuch Spirits, as like vacabonds, wandred vp and downe the world, being worthily puniſhed by the great and iuſt Gods. Many gaſtly Caues, were (there) to be found, but ſo horrible were they, as the onely ſight of them brought trembling feare to the mindes, and ſudden amazement to the eyes of ſuch as ſhould behold them. No running Fountaine was there that gaue forth criſtall water; no ſhadowing groue, to keepe men from parching heate; nor any greene coolie graſſe with faire coloured flowers, to delight the ſences: onely in this vncoth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, did ſoiourne ſuch ſad, and old angrie men, as by there nightly Charmes forced the Spirites of the earth to obey their wills and to be at their command. In ſteede of Nightingale and Lark, was there found the Scritching Owle and night Rauen, with ſuch

His rare conſtancie bare patiently the loſſe of his goods, tooke gently his baniſhment from his countrie, endured quietly the crueltie of time, and brooked wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the iniuries of the enuious; but vnto this Loue, it yeelded quickly, and as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint.

                  <hi rend="margQuotes">The remembrance of things loſt, is forgotten through length of time, the paine of deadlieſt ſickneſſes, is appeaſed by Phiſicke, and the deepeſt conceited ſorrow, weareth away with often ſighing; but alas, his loue was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies liuing, without ende, and without truce, as a ſubſtance euerlaſting.</hi> Too, too cruell was that ſtar, that ſhonne at his birth, but farre more remorſleſſe, the care and griefe of his continuall vexed life. And in reſpect of him, happie are all other whatſoeuer, who are tormented with the loſſe of their kinde friends, deare countrie, louing families and acquaintance, all which though they be much grieuous to ſupport and ſuffer, yet are they not to be compared in rigor, vnto the leaſt paſſion of Loue; for the Soule findeth in them, ſome one comfort or other, and the bodie ſome eaſe of griefe, or (at the leaſt) an ende of all: but in the pangs of Loue, neither the one nor the other are euer out of trouble. Wretched then is the man that leueth, therefore, wretched this Shepheard, and yet more happie then ſuch contented perſons, who liue alwaies fearing death: whereas, the approach of the ſame, was the onely hauen and heauen of his vnhappines, Such, and ſo great was the extremities of his woes, as it hindred him, to marke or conceiue the fearefulnes of this deſart, &amp; to apprehend the horror of ſo frightfull a dwelling. He thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of nothing leſſe, then of the horriblenes of the ſame. Such condemned Soules, as are drawne vnto the place of execution, dreame not of any thing elſe, then of the bitter death they goe to ſuffer. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, ſought not he any other iourney in this wilderneſſe, then ſuch as his paſſion led him on to take, his eyes not being employed in any office at all, whileſt he himſelfe ſeemed to be both deafe, blinde, and dumme. O ſage and prudent Poets, who to expreſſe the nature and effects of Loue moſt properly, faine Louers to haue bin changed into inſenſible ſhapes: for certainely, they are but Stones, Trees, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15406:6"/>Rocks, in their actions and behauiour, although they retaine and keepe with them a humane ſhape. A long time did this miſerable Shepheard walke thus, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way he went, vntill at the laſt for verie wearines, he was forced to reſt himſelfe at the foote of a mightie high Rocke. There, being ſet vpon the ground, his armes a croſſe, his eyes lifted vp, his lips cloſe ſhut together, leaning his head vpon the ſtone, which hung on the one ſide, he ſeemed as if he had bin another very Rocke; for, as a Rocke, ſo were his geſtures, moue-leſſe, his ſpirits gone, and all the partes of his bodie without force and vigor. And to ſay the truth indeede, how could he once ſtirre, if his Soule being the life of his bodie, was as then abſent, and at that time retired into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his faire Miſtris? Thus ſat he ſenſeleſſe a great while, with a heauie ſetled coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, vntill at laſt, looking downe lowe with his eyes, he eſpied certaine verſes to be carued moſt curiouſly within the Rocke, which made him reſemble the Hunter,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> who diſpairing of his Prey, and hauing (as it were) quite forgotten the ſame, vpon the ſoden ſpieth his game, which forceth him to begin a freſh the purſuite thereof, and ſo followeth the chaſe againe. O how great power hath our deſire ouer our Soules, that it is of force preſently to reuiue our ſenſes, to awaken our thoughts, to plucke vp our Spirits, and to change and alter our countenances! The great longing he had to reade that large wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, awaked him out of his dreame, recalled home his former wits, &amp; brought him again to be a right man. He turned his eyes too and fro, buſying himſefe, about the reading of thoſe lines, but little pleaſure conceiued he of the ſame, becauſe he could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, by reaſon they were carued in letters of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which made him fret and fume; Not vnlike vnto one, who ſeeking to paſſe ouer a Riuer,<note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> cannot find the loweſt and ſhallow eſt place through which he might wade moſt ſafeſt; ſo as, being in great coller againſt Nature, he burſt out into theſe ſpeeches. Ah cruell Stepdame, when wilt thou be glutted with the miſeries of mortall men? At too high a rate doeſt thou ſell that little aduantage and benefit, which they haue ouer other liuing creatures. To what ende ſerues it them to be more perfect then beaſtes, if this perfection, taketh from them their moſt deſired reſt? and what profit is it for one to be rich, if that treaſure of his, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth trauaile, and care, which moſt cruelly weareth away his life? Farre happier by ods are the bruite beaſtes, for ignorance taketh away from them the apprehenſion of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, the thought of riches, and the ſorrow that is incident vnto this life: whereas the minde of man, is toſſed too and fro, not onely with vnquietnes of ſuch things as are preſent, but alſo for ſuch as are before paſſed, and are yet to come: yea (and that in ſuch ſtrange wiſe, as man is thought to be ſtill miſerable, excepting onely, in that ſmall time, wherein he is freed and releaſed from thoſe mortall cares and knawing <hi>Corſiues.</hi> Alack,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> alack, as with the tree, the rinde groweth, and ſprowteth vp, the one not being able to continue without the other; ſo with Man, is carefulnes ingendred, which as a moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate euill Angell, followeth him in all his actions he taketh in hand. Who is he, that euer hath bin liuing without the feeling of griefe or ſorrow, or without the taſt of vexation and vnquietnes? The mornings houre frameth and plotteth one miſerie or other againſt the euening, as the extreame rage of ardent heate maketh a ſtorme, or tempeſt, which halleth fire and water together. For one taſt of pleaſure which he enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, a thouſand deſires of death ſeaze on his ſpirits, to the ende he might quench all his heauie diſaſters, by ſuch a ſpeedie meanes: for more happier are ſenſeleſſe creatures, then they, whoſe bodies are onely put to trauaile, and not their mindes at all: and in reſpect of the vnfortunate plagues of this life, a thriſe bleſſed companion is death, who ought to be counted a remedie and helpe, rather then any paine, or trouble. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thriſe happie indeede, are you moſt valiant Spirits, who of your owne braue coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, haue dared to ſhorten by violence the miſeries of your loathed liues, thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge and cut off the multitude of ſorrowes belonging vnto the ſame. Vnkinde Nature, what gifts doeſt thou prodigally beſtowe vpon man, but bitter wailings and ſalt teares? No ſooner are we borne, but teares come forth with vs, following vs in all the courſe of our liues, and not leauing vs vntill our lateſt death. Of earth doeſt thou frame our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to earth doeſt thou turne the ſame againe; And yet alas, not before thou haſt made vs to take the aſlay of many miſerable calamities. Neither haſt thou made rightly perfect any one man, there being alwaies in his life, one fault, or another; for ſeldome or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15406:7"/>neuer find we an excellent and quick Spirit, in a well ſhaped and comely bodie, nor an exquiſite well made bodie to containe in the ſame a rare and admirable minde. But it is no wonder at all, that thoſe, who are thy Subiects, children, and vaſſals, want their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when thou thine owne ſelfe,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> haſt failed and doeſt come behind of the ſame. Hardly can the people of a cruell king, be brought to be gentle and milde, and as hardly can men thy creatures attaine to come to be perfect, when thou thy ſelfe, on whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, art naturally full of defects and wants. I pray thee tell me, what charges had it bin vnto thee, if thou hadſt giuen vnto euery one an inſight and skill in forraigne languages? and why doeſt thou depriue ſo many mindes deſirous of knowledge in all things, for want of vnderſtanding ſtrange tongues, in which thou giueſt a plaine teſtimome, either of thine owne imperfection, or elſe of thy ouermuch crueltie? if thou art imperfect, then can nothing, that is faire, excellent, or perfect, be found amongſt vs: for of the ſeedes of thiſtles, can neuer corne ſpring: and if thou be cruell, then miſerable is the eſtate of man, to be gouerned and ſubiugated vnder the yoke of ſuch a bloudie and inhumane <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</hi> Both which vices (I doubt not) but abound in thee; Certainly thou art imperfect, rendring ſo many bodies emptie and voyd of all perfection, as Monſters, faſhioned without forme; And cruell thou art, making men more wretched, or rather farreworſe, then rude and ſauadge beaſtes. Thus exclaimed the poore Pilgrime, mad for anger that he could not vnderſtand that ſtrange writing. And as a ſmall matter of loſſe bringeth more dammage vnto him, who commeth from going about a farre greater, whilſt the ſame is a doing, and feeleth the croſſe thereof, to be more then if the ſaid little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance had hapned whilſt he was in proſperitie; So this pettie deſpite galled the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard more, by reaſon he was as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plunged in a bottomles pit of diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentments, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it had chaunced when he had liued moſt at eaſe and pleaſure. But now, as he was laying himſelfe downe to make his praiers vnto the morning ſleepe, to charme and cloſe vp his eyes and trauaile for a while, he might perceiue on the ſudden a certaine aged man, ſtanding hard behind him. This good old Father, had a long beard, as white as ſnowe, his haire of his head was hoarie and graie, his forehead wrinkled, his face furrowed, his eyes ſunke in his head, his lippes great and blacke, his eye-browes thicke as briſtles, his hands riueled, and nothing but skinne and bone, his apparell a beares caſe, his feete bare and naked, hauing in his right hand a ſtaffe, and in his left a booke. The complaint of the Shepheard had, he heard, and he being one that was aſſiſted and holpen by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Nature, in the charmes and enchantments which he vſed, was not a little moued to heare her ſo ſharpely blamed. Whereupon he reſolued to take her cauſe in hand, and as a friendly counſeller to pleade in her behalfe, inſomuch as without once ſaluting or greeting the diſcontented <hi>Arcas,</hi> in a friendly manner he thus began to anſwere him. Alas poore ſilly ſoule, to what ende doeſt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to be like vnto the fire, that burneth that that nouriſheth her, or to the viper that knaweth her mother in pieces, or to the vngratefull churle, that murdereth his beſt benefactor? Dareſt thou ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſpeake again ſt her, that is the Mother, the Queene, and the Nurſe of all things? Moſt mortall enemie of the Gods, who acknowledge her for their vaiuerſall Mother, whom thou blameſt, with ſo great blaſphemie. Who giueth their eſſence and Being, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liuing creatures, but ſhe? who maketh them to liue, and moue but ſhe? Should not this great obſcure <hi>Caos,</hi> (but for her) turne againe into his confuſed forme, &amp; the Elements be confuſedly mingled one with another? Who hath giuen Soule and life vnto man, but ſhe? When the expert Phyſition hath done all he can to the vttermoſt of his Art, to heale the ſicke patients; if he then caſteth away his medicine, and refuſeth wilfully his owne health, is it the Doctors fault if he be taken away by death? If thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both a ſoule and ſufficient vigor and force of Nature, and for default of vſing the ſame wiſely, ill fortune hath ſeazed and taken hold vpon thee: canſt thou iuſtly lay the cauſe of thy miſhap vpon Nature? O foole as thou art, know thou, that our Spirits and our bodies haue receiued all perfection that may be, and the very beſt of euery vertue that is in any other liuing creature,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> is beſtowed vpon vs. Vnto a wiſe man nothing is vnpoſſible, neither can the ſtars themſelues preuaile ought againſt him. But if he will needes loſe himſelfe, if he will imploy his good gifts, againſt his owne ſelfe, as the ſuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, who woundeth his heart with his owneſword, can the blame thereof be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15406:7"/>vnto Nature? That vaſſall that hath receiued all good and kinde entertainement and vſage of his Lord, and yet afterward will faile of his duetic,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> doth he bring his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be guiltie of his offence, or can he make him to be the Author of this his ſo groſſe tollie? I think not. If ſo, why haſt thou then ſuffered thy ſelfe ſo fooliſhly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, cheated, and depriued of that force, and vertue, that Nature hath lent thee, laying vpon her, all the blame for the loſſe of the ſame? Thou affirmeſt that man is miſerable, and therefore little beholding vnto Nature, but vpon what Foundation, vpon what Rocke, or vpon what ſure ground canſt thou proue her to be the cauſe of his miſerie? Doth he want any thing that is conuenient and fit for him? hath he not the forme and ſhape of the Gods? Is not his Soule diuine? and doth it not participate with wiſedome, knowledge, and vnderſtanding? and if thou wilt not allow, Wiſedome, Knowledge, and Science, to be in the number of the beſt things, then doſt thou deface euery vertue, and by this meanes thou makeſt men, to be no better then brute and ſenſeleſſe beaſtes. But knowledge (ſaieſt thou) bringeth vnto man, care, and vexation of mind, which like a worme, eateth and knaweth him continually, and (yet) doth the ſame vnderſtanding, make him to approach nigh vnto the Gods, bringing him to be farre more perfect, then when he knew nothing. O what an vnſpeakable ioy doth he conceiue in his ſoule, when he is once able to attaine vnto the diſcouerie of thoſe admirable effects of God? being able through his knowledge to preuent ſuch miſchiefes as are at hand, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer others from preſent ſhipwracks of imminent misfortunes? Thou addeſt, that theſe things encreaſe and ingender ſad thoughts in his minde: but what paine, what griefe, what moleſtation, or trouble, is there found (be it neuer ſo ſharpe &amp; ſtinging) which can once counteruaile, or compare, with the ambroſiall ſweetnes of that renowned glory, which that man ſwalloweth downe along time, who rightly and perfectly doth but iudge &amp; conceiue of celeſtiall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; by his prudencie &amp; skill, maketh himſelfe moſt profitable and neceſſarie vnto his common-wealth? All thoſe other bad conceites, paſſe and vaniſh away, as a ſudden ſtorme, but moſt durable and for euerlaſting, is that glory, which man buildeth and eſtabliſheth vpon the rockie ground of neuer failing vertue. Great <hi>Hercules,</hi> (as now,<note place="margin">An example.</note>) feeleth no more the paine of all thoſe hugie labors which he once endured in this world, for that is dead and gone, but his glorious renowne, his worthy name and fame endureth ſtill, and ſhall for euermore. But thou caſteſt thine eyes, vpon ſuch things onely as are preſent, which are flitting and not durable, fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy complaint vpon a vaine and light ſhadow, without bethinking thee once of that ſubſtance of Eternitie, that is to come hereafter.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> True glorie is neuer gotten but by great labour and trauaile; and vertue beſt ſhineth through deadlieſt dangers, as the Sunne ſhoweth cleareſt, amongſt the darkeſt cloudes. Hadſt thou but any high courage in thee, or wert thou brauely pricked forward with the ſpur of honour, thou wouldſt neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſo much as thou doſt this preſent time, but wouldſt rather haue reſpect to what is like to come hereafter; for right wretched is he, that with his dying body encloſeth and burieth his name, his glory, and all his exploytes, all within one obſcure tombe. Blame not Nature then, who hath made man perfect in all parts and compliments, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him the direct meanes to enter into the right way which leadeth him vnto the place of Eternitie. And if thou canſt not vnderſtand theſe <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bique</hi> letters, the fault is thine owne, and not Natures, who hath giuen thee a mind to conceiue, and a tongue, to learne to practiſe and ſpeake. But there is no reaſon, that without labour and taking of paine, we ſhould come to purchaſe our deſires, ſince through this trauaile, the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature is the better knowne, producing many faire effects within our ſoules, firſt formed and inuented by her, which without induſtrie would remaine quite extinguiſht, and of no force, not vnlike vnto ſenſeleſſe ſtones. The Shepheard wakened with this biting diſcourſe, began to take heart at graſſe, replying vpon the old man in this ſort. Whatſoeuer thou art, that ſheweſt thy ſelfe ſo charitable and deuout, in thy deuoyre and dutie towards Nature, chriſtning her with the name of perfect; I muſt needes tell thee, thou art wonderfull wide from the truth, and not a little deceiued in this matter; For if ſuch perfection were found in her (as thou ſpeakeſt) why then doth ſhe not make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man perfect alike? whereas (quite contrarie) from ſome, ſhe taketh away their health, through long and ſtrange Maladies, which by her owne name, are tearmed naturall;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15406:8"/>from others, ſhe curtalleth and loppeth off their beſt members, whereby they growe deformed and misſhapen; ſome others ſhe abridgeth, and taketh away from them their right wits, and ſenſes, making them become innocents, and fooles; and from others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, ſhe withdraweth her liberall hand of plentie, forcing them to liue in great want and beggerie. Now what perfection is here found in theſe ſo diuers contrarie effects? for of that thing which is perfect, nothing can proceede but what is perfect, like vnto it ſelfe; As it happeneth amongſt Lions &amp; Lioneſſes, which alwaies reſemble one another: but from Nature, diuers effects doe happen vnperfect, and therefore is not ſhe her ſelfe perfect. Now, badly (quoth the old man) herein doe you conclude, for both Nature her ſelfe is perfect, and ſo are her workes alſo. Perfect are her workes, in that ſhe doth diſtribute vnto euery one, that which ſhe knoweth to be moſt neceſſarie for him. Some doth ſhe cauſe to be ſicke, to the ende ſhe may ſmoother and kill the force and power of ſuch vices, as they haue ouer greedily ſwallowed downe. From others ſhe taketh away their right wits and memorie, to make them forget the conceit and thought of high and aſpiring deſignes, and to bring them to thinke of baſe and lowe matters; vpon the conſeruation of which, dependeth the eſtate and ſafetie of their Superious: and from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhe keepeth backe her treaſures, to the ende ſhe might acquaint them with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie labour and tillage of the earth; which rendereth a moſt ſacred and diume teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of her perfection, without which, the moſt worthieſt Spirits, addicted wholly vnto glory, ſhould be conſtrained to forſake and yeelde their bodies vnto death, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing famiſhed for want of ſuſtenance: and as her perfection is exquiſite, ſo is her puiſſance incomprehenſible, and the effects of the ſame moſt admirable; ſo as who ſolloweth her ſteps alwaies orderly, ſhall neuer groſely erre, nor offend ſhamefully. And yet (replied the Shepheard) diuers that haue offended, erring through Nature, haue by Art much amended their defects: whereas neuer hath there bin knonwe any one that hath bin found to be perfect, through the benefit of Nature: As we ſee the Sages &amp; wiſe men, (that liued heretofore in the olde world,) ſpent many yeares to correct, by knowledge and experience, the defaults of lame Nature. But that knowledge (anſwered the old man) proceeded from the ſelfe ſame Nature, in ſuch wiſe, as ſhe is not to be blamed at all for the ſame, nor to be thought any thing the more vnperfect for it; ſeeing that as ſhe was the cauſe of that ill, ſo ſhe brought a remedie for the ſame; and that ſo holeſome a one, as the wound being once cured,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> the whole body euer after was the better, being cleare purged of all his defects. Not vnlike vnto the body of man, which being purified, through a comfortable potion, is not onely freed of that diſeaſe which as then infected him, but euer after is the better in health for that holeſome Phiſicke. We ſee that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Surgion maketh inciſion, and cutteth off fleſh, to the ende the whole body may be the more healthfull and ſound: ſo this experieece which Nature hath beſtowed vpon man, is ſo perfect and neceſſarie, as he may iudge himſelfe to be right happie, to haue found ſome ſuch ſmall defect of Nature in himſelfe, ſince they haue bin of force to learne him how to helpe himſelfe, and how to vſe this excellent knowledge vnto his great aduantage, which not onely cleanſeth him from his faults preſent, but from ſuch likewiſe as are to come hereafter. What is that you ſaid (anſwered <hi>Arcas</hi>) as though there be not many faults and imperfections of Nature, and thoſe of ſo high a qualitie, as no experience nor skill, be it neuer ſo great, can euer amend them, or once be able to doe good of them: how many incurable diſeaſes are there that no Phiſicke can helpe them? and how many cruell and deſperate inconueniences, that no Art can withſtand them? No, no: Nature her ſelfe can neuer deliuer vnto man any one knowledge ſufficient, (no, although we would graunt that wiſedome proceeded from her, as it doth not) which were of force and power enough to amend and correct her owne faults, and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I will demaund but this one queſtion of you, whether you thinke there be any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall prudence, or foreſight ſtrong enough, to helpe that ſicknes which proceedeth from Loue? and whether Louers haue not good reaſon, iuſtly to complaine of Nature, who without any ſuccour or helpe, halleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſo cruelly vnto ſuch inexpiable miſeries? Nay then (quoth the old man) if you come to encounter againſt me, with the power of Loue, I muſt needs haue the field, and yeeld the prize vnto you. For I my ſelfe, although I haue drawne thouſands of treaſures from Nature, all which are ſufficient proofes of her
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15406:8"/>beautifulnes, of her power &amp; vertue; yet could I neuer find by her meanes any remedie againſt this incurable diſeaſe. Incurable, may I call it, ſince it hath made me to abandon the world, to liue this ſolitarie kinde of life, whereby I might beguile my vnſupportable paines, and ſo (in the ende) finde death the onely right Soueraigne cordiall and helpe to eaſe and ende this helliſh diſeaſe. And if the ſelfeſame accident, hath brought thee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a companion vnto me in my miſeries: I ſhall be very willing to diſcourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, the diſaſtred aduentures of my Loue; and as gladly euery way to vnderſtand the hapleſſe courſe of thine owne. It is the onely thing I moſt deſire (replied <hi>Arcas</hi>) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I doubt ſhrodely, that the memorie of my bitter troubles, will hardly afford me free vtterance of ſpeech, to recite and repeate at full, the diſcourſe of mine infinite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and, I feare me, leaſt the ſadde remembrance of my renewed griefes, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and breake the ſlender threed of my feeble voice. But before I begin, let me intreat you to expound and to enterpret vnto me, theſe <hi>Arabique</hi> verſes, &amp; the ſubſtance of the ſame. Withall my hart anſwered the old man, but firſt let vs take our places for our more eaſe, vnder the ſhade of this coolie rocke, that the faire coloured greene of theſe ſight pleaſing odoriferous hearbes, may be partakers of ſo lamentable an Hiſtorie. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the old man (with <hi>Arcas</hi>) ſat him downe, where he thought fitteſt for himſelfe, when hauing now alreadie caſt his eyes vpon the Caracters, readie to report them in the French language) a ſad accent of a heauie voice, cauſed him (on the ſoden) to ſtop, &amp; be ſilent: not vnlike that Marchant, who trauailing on the way to goe his voyage,<note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> ſodenly turneth backe, leauing his companie, with whome (before) he had iournied, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the way as he paſſed to vnderſtand, of the too too vntimely death of his deare &amp; louing Spouſe. This voice rauiſhed the ſoules of both our Pilgrimes, reuiuing a freſh memorie of their loues within their hearts, tooke away from them all other thoughs, the better to make them dreame of their paſſions, and brought them into their former eſtates of their Loues, in which they were at the firſt. And this following, was the Song, which that ſweete breaſt breathed forth moſt ſweetely, accompanied with thouſands of deepe and profound ſighes.</p>

O, how ſweete, and pleaſing a thing, is this kind of amitie, which keepeth the Gods in perfect vnitie, and vnder whoſe puiſſance, is the hollow giuing vault of heauen guided? Men, (after the example of the Gods) by the aduiſe of Loue, firſt aſſem bled themſelues together, vniting and incorporating themſelues, within Cities, and walled Townes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſauadge wilderneſſes vnto wilde beaſts, wherein, they before did inhabit. Why then doeſt thou offer blood vnto him? O Father of theſe nocturnall Deſarts (anſwered the Shepheard) I know thou thinkeſt otherwiſe then thou ſpeakeſt. Canſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and frame a gentle and milde Nature,<note place="margin">An example.</note> of nothing but murther and crueltie? How many maſſacres loue hath commenced, <hi>Troy</hi> can witneſſe. How many cruell griefes, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15406:17"/>inſupportable miſeries are in the hearts of Louers <hi>Ariadne</hi> knoweth; And how many falſe Treaſons, and blaſphemous periuries, <hi>Oenone</hi> feeleth. Why then wilt thou iuſtifie him, he hauing theſe foule faults? Euerie bodie that lodgeth not reaſon within it ſelfe, is blame-worthie. And what reaſon I pray you, is their found in Loue? He is a traiterous <hi>Drogerar,</hi> and a Phyſition of mens hearts, for ſome he healeth and comforteth, and other-ſome, he vexeth, killeth, and tormenteth; He is blind-folded, which is enough and ſufficient proofe to make thee know his imperfections. Thinke not the worſe of him for that (ſaid the old man) for Iuſtice is vnited, which brooketh no compariſon, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and vertue. Loue is blinded, becauſe he ſhould haue no reſpect of perſons, to the ende, greateſt Kings may be no more exempted from his power, then the pooreſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. He is blind, to ſhew, that he walketh without craft or diſſimulation: for that is no true and ſincere amitie, where falſenes of heart lodgeth, and where treaſon and diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie lurketh. If Loue, (ſeeing clearely with his eyes) ſhould ſpare Princes and Potentates, what profit then ſhould the poorer ſort receiue through this friendſhip? For Loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth the rich, and haughtieſt courages, to affect and honour the poore &amp; baſeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to doe them all ſeruice poſſible they can; And this is the reaſon that Loue is vailed, and not meere folly. For he ſhall neuer be counted vnwiſe, who without any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alteration, or paſſion whatſoeuer, taketh his way and courſe directly and iuſtly, without ſparing great perſonages, who are made for the ſupport and helpe of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and pooreſt ſort of people. Yet this vaile (anſwered <hi>Arcas</hi>) taketh away the light of knowledge, hindring him from ſeeing, what he ought to doe; So that as a blinde man (without a guide) falleth into the ditch. Euen ſo <hi>Cupid</hi> for want of ſight, committeth many thouſands of groſe enormities, which being put in practiſe, chriſten him with the name of a furie, in ſteed of Loue. Is that right loue, which altereth the minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quite topſic turuie in all their proceedings? in ſuch wiſe, as one ſhalbe forced to loue her, who hateth him; and another, ſhall be beloued of her, whome he cannot in any wiſe abide? Are not theſe effects, meere enmities &amp; deſpights, plaine rage, and furie? If ſo, why then, moſt vnworthie is Loue of this name, attributed vnto him. Thogh Iuſtice be vailed, yet moſt loyall, iuſt, vnpartiall, and ſacred, are her proceedings: whereas thoſe of Loue, are quite contrarie. Therefore you conclude ill, to affirme that Loue is blinded, like vnto Iuſtice, which though it be all one thing, yet is the cauſe different, for the one carrieth her vaile to a good ende, and the other to a bad purpoſe; I report me vnto the vniuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of this little blind Infant. Alas poore ſoules (replied the old man) what more ſheweth the admirable puiſſance of God, then the diuerſitie of effects, proceeding from himſelfe? what giueth ſo much glorie vnto the Painter, as the varietie of faire Pictures, which he doth moſt cunningly portray forth and embolliſh? Euen ſo, why, doth Loue bring forth ſo many and contrarie cauſes, but onely to ſhew himſelfe the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? &amp; to lay ſtrong, the diuine foundations of his mightie power? He bringeth forth ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which, althogh they are all differing, yet be they alwaies ſuch, as are agreeable with the diuerſitie of the natures of man, gouerning euery thing with a kind of prudent poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnknowne, far aboue our reaches. For elſe, it might peraduenture ſo fall out, that it might be more worſe for him that loueth to be beloued againe, then if he ſhould be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the wiſedome of the Gods, cannot be comprehended within our feeble ſpirits. But this is the ſhallow conceit that mortall men haue, rather then to thinke that to be firme, holy, iuſt, and good, which the Gods themſelues goe about to enterpriſe: For it is not to be thought otherwiſe, but that they who are perfect, (as the Gods themſelues) and are no way ſpotted or polluted with vice, can doe any thing, that is vniuſt, imperfect, or fooliſh. In reſpect of the Gods (anſwered the Shepheard) I auow, what you affirme: yet by your leaue, I denie that loue may be admitted amongſt this troope. Thoſe inſolent Tyrants, who vſe their licentious will, in ſteed of rightfull Loue, (whoſe conſtraining force, maketh them to be feared,) although they be puiſſant &amp; mightie, yet cannot they entitle themſelues with the names of iuſt and prudent Princes. And ſo, I allow of the greatnes of the power of Loue, but not of his Deitie. God taketh no pleaſure in the fal of man, his creature, but Loue ſeeketh the ſame; God eſtabliſheth all things in good ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by a certaine ſacred order: but Loue diſmembreth, ſcattereth, ſeparateth &amp; breaketh the peace and quietnes of man, and therefore he is no God. Moſt damnable perſons are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15406:18"/>thoſe who being troubled, with ſome ſupernaturall and violent power, attribute moſt wickedly vnto the Iuſt, Sacred, and diuine God, the furious and raging fittes of braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke Loue. Therefore, let vs neuer pronounce this broad blaſphemie; for ſo farre off is Loue, from being a God, that mortall men are able to conquere and take him (as it were) priſoner.</p>
               <p>If this be true (replyed the olde Sire) who then is it, that maketh thee thus to ſtoope? who hath yoked thee, and made thee bowe thy necke vnto this God? and wherefore doeſt not thou trample and treade vpon him, he being but a man?</p>
               <p>That Captaine that is conquered by a braue victorious enemy, is worthie of blame, but farre more is he to be condemned, that ſuffereth himſelfe to be ledde away Captiue by a weake &amp; feeble aduerſarie. If Loue be a thing of ſo ſmall worth, why then, doeſt thou not chaſe him away from thee? In vaine therfore be theſe teares, which thou now ſheddeſt: in vaine thy complaints, and in vaine theſe ſorrowes, which thou ſtil makeſt. Fond is that ſicke bodie that may helpe himſelfe, and who (becauſe as one ſelfe-wild, will not) ſuffereth himſelfe to be infected with a diſeaſe, too weake for him, if he were willing to ſtriue &amp; wraſtle with the ſame Euen ſo art thou fond, to languiſh as a vaſſaile vnto this God, ſo long a time in this maner, when (if thou wilt) thou canſt va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſh him.</p>
               <p>O fooliſh Slaue,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> that being able to free himſelfe without danger, from ſeruitude, yet neuertheleſſe, continueth ſo, all his life! But the bragging Souldier may alwayes threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, his foe being abſent, againſt whom appearing once in ſight, he dareth not once ſo much as drawe his ſword. So thou ſeemeſt to contemne Loue, yet in the meane time, dareſt not for thy life to reſiſt him: and beeing valiant a farre off, thou yeeldeſt at the firſt encountring together. But this one thing I will tell thee, that amongſt all the deadly paſſions, that doe ruinate and ouerthrow man, there is none ſo ſtrong, nor vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as this of Loue; death it ſelfe being farre more ſweeter then that is.</p>
               <p>How often doe we ſee men ſing, when they are at point of death, eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues right bleſſed for to die? whereas the Louer (not beloued againe) butchereth and killeth himſelfe, running headlong into all dangers, and as one furious, looſeth all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and all good hopes to come.</p>
               <p>Man endureth reſolutely, all other accidents of misfortunes, which ordinarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto him, but being plagued with Loue, it rauiſheth and bereaueth him, of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and valour, and of his conſtancie and welfare. Therfore is he more mighty then all other things, which eyther deſcend from Heauen, or proceed from forth the earth.</p>
               <p>Mightie indeed, muſt I needes ſay hee is, (quoth the Shepheard) yet I eſteeme him but as vnwiſe, that maketh any account of vniuſt puiſſance. Without Iuſtice, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are but robberies, and without reaſon, the Gods alſo, are but ſinners: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnworthie of that name.</p>
               <p>If euery one were iuſt, what neede ſhould we haue then, of Lawes and compulſions? Doeſt thou make account of Loue, becauſe hee is ſtrong and violent? why ſo is the Sea, tempeſtuous, ſtrong, violent, rough, and of great power: but are his waters, as wholeſome, freſh, ſweet, and good, as are thoſe of ſprings and leſſer fountaines.</p>
               <p>Knowledge is a glorie to him that poſſeſſeth the ſame, in ſeruing himſelfe wiſely and diſcreetely, but as hee maketh it a refuge for vice, and a ſupport to ſuch wrongs and iniuries, as he putteth in practiſe, it is his vtter ruine and ouerthrowe. Bad force for a time, may compell to be obeyed, but it is quickly gone, the feare thereof alſo, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſame: where contrariwiſe, Iuſtice purchaſed without compulſion, to Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and dominere ouer mens ſoules, is alwayes highly honored. Nothing that is built vpon rigor, can long endure, the ſelf-ſame force, driuing forcibly away the firſt violence: but Iuſtice neuer ouerthroweth the works of Iuſtice,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> for that they are vpright and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of life. I confeſſe indeed, not a little to my griefe, that I am the ſlaue of Loue, for ſometimes a Prince hapneth to be the vaſſaile of a ſimple &amp; meane Captaine, and in as much as men (borne to ſuffer) are bondmen by Fortune, &amp; vaſſels of the earth, God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of them according vnto his owne will. But the ſick patient often blameth his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, which he feeleth, &amp; imagineth, to be little or nothing dangerous at all; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretheleſſe, cannot he rid himſelfe of the ſame, when hee faineſt would.</p>
               <p>The Beare, for want of knowing his owne ſtrength, yeeldeth vnto a leſſe force, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15406:18"/>man is perfect in knowledge, yet becauſe bee wants the right vſe thereof, hee is but as a burning Candle vnder a buſhell. And as for Loue, my conceit is, that yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto him, I obey the leaſt power that is in heauen, or on earth. And I am of an other opinion, anſwered the olde man, for I thinke it can no way turne vnto diſcredit, to render ſeruice vnto him, whom the greateſt Gods deuoutly honour. The Seruant ought not to ſcorne to attend vpon him, to whome his Maiſter himſelfe doth belong.</p>
               <p>The Gods (replied the Shepheard) honored Loue, whil'ſt he lent them his hand,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> and aſſiſted them in their voluptuous paſtimes. <hi rend="margQuotes">Profit, oftentimes is the cauſe, that a man doth reuerence vnto ſuch a one, as he eſteemeth to be a farre worſe man then himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot (ſaid the olde man) tearme that thing leſſe then our ſelues, which hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to command ouer vs; And if wee be obedient vnto Loue, then is he more diuine and great then wee our ſelues are.</p>
               <p>Indeed (replyed the Shepheard) he is mightier in malice, but leaude behauiour and miſchieuouſnes, cannot be regiſtred amongſt the Catalogue of Famous enterpriſes. Then is not he mightie, that maketh men illuſtrious in this pointe, but rather weake, and of no reckening, inaſ-much as puiſſance, with the defect, is as droſſe, and baſe traſh: and Vertue, though it be poore, is an eternall treaſure.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this (anſwered the olde man) the moſt learned erected Altars heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto him, enterpriſing more for his honor, then for any other Celeſtial God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. And wee being leſſe wiſe then they, wee cannot as I geſſe, much faile, to followe their foot-ſteps.</p>
               <p>The propertie of gold (replyed the Shepheard) is ſometimes changed. Suger, now and then becommeth bitter and ſower, and the brighteſt day, is often darkened with thicke clouds: euen ſo, the wiſeſt, now and then forget themſelues, yet their faults ought not to be, as a warrant vnto the poſteritie hereafter to come; becauſe, that vice, which the miniſters of any vertue doe commit, ſhall neuer be allowed of by her voyce, the ſame being as perſonall, and not publike. The Sages, then hauing erred, wee muſt likewiſe needes acknowledge their offence, which taxeth them, for committing the ſame. Yet in the meane time (ſaide the olde man) ſee how Loue is here noted, to be ouer-powerfull and mighty, ſeeing he forceth and compelleth the wiſeſt to doe amiſſe.</p>
               <p>Truth (quoth the Shepheard) but as out of a heapeof corne, we make choyce of our wheate, and leaue the cockle: So of the actions and proceedings of moſt diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wee ſhould chuſe the beſt, and leaue the worſt. For as they are men, they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to erre, and wander aſtray. Vertue, being alwayes a good preſident vnto vs, but not vice: In aſmuch as ſuch as follow the vertuous ſhall be commended, where thoſe that imitate the bad, ſhall be as much blamed and condemned.</p>
               <p>Well then, my good Shepheard (anſwered the old man) let vs giue ouer, from argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any further about this <hi>LOVE,</hi> &amp; recount vnto me the ſubiect of thy griefe, &amp; the cauſe of this thy ſtrange wandring, or miſerable exile, amongſt theſe ſolitary dwellings.</p>
               <p>Ah my deare Father (replyed <hi>Arcas</hi>) more dangerous is the ſecond ſickneſſe, then the firſt, it being of the ſelfe ſame qualitie, and happening not long after; and ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſhall I finde my troubles, in imparting vnto thee my misfortunes, as I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, felt bloody, the effects of the ſame. Ceaſe therefore, to enquire of mee about that, where of the remembrance alone killeth me to thinke therevpon: For what good can it doe vnto the whole, to demand of the diſeaſed, the cauſe of his ſickneſſe? and what profit will it be vnto thee, to heare me recite my drerie Fortunes? No, no, rather doe I thinke it meeteſt to conceale them, leaſt I ſhould prouoke men, to exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gods, when they ſhall perceiue how partiall, and vnnaturall, they haue bene alwaies againſt mee.</p>
               <p>Woe is me, excepting my miſchance, euery maladie, all paine, and euery ſorrowe, haue their proper remedie. The Eternitie of the Gods, is not more ſure, then my haples diſaſter, (ſtill to continue) is moſt certaine. It is far from the nature of all other diſeaſes, for that which healeth others, woundeth me. O Heauens, what hope of health reſteth for that miſerable wretch, who when he hath embraced all the wholſom Altars of the Gods, is yet as vnfortunate, as euer he was before? But what is violent, cannot by the courſe of Nature be long permanent: And if it be ſo, why then am I exempted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15406:19"/>from this rule? Neuer was any euill more violent then mine, and yet in the meane time, it thus continueth ſtill extreame.</p>
               <p>O deceitfull ſentence! Alack, alack, double doe I feele my griefe, the one, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, &amp; the other, in liuing to endure it: and yet what ſhould let me from murthering of mine owne ſelfe, but euen the ſelfe-ſame charge, which the Maiſter gineth vnto his ſlaue, ouer whom he hath command, both of life and death? The onely Phyſitions which carefully aſſiſt me in my diſeaſe, are Death and Diſpaire: Comfortable is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of Death, but damnable is the ſyrup of Diſpaire. The one hindreth the other, not vnlike vnto two contrary windes, which hold and keepe in, a tottering Ship in the maine Sea, it being not able to ſaile, neither of the one ſide, nor of the other.</p>
               <p>Thrice welcome ſhould death be vnto me, if naturally, and without diſpaire, it would come on the ſodaine, to rid me from this trouble: So thrice happie diſpaire, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death, it could chaſe away this my more then intollerable anguiſh from mee.</p>
               <p>Betweene theſe two contrary windes doe I flote, not that I will denie, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the Sunne-ſhine of my ſoule, hath made mine eyes cleare and bright, but yet in ſuch ſort hath it bene, as the light thereof preſently after, hath cauſed my darkneſſe to ſhew more gaſtly, fearefull, and horrible.

And what happie Countrey is at this houre, warmed with the gladſome Luſter of thy beautious light?

               <p>O God, if our ſinnes inflict vpon vs theſe plagues, wherewith wee are tortured, yet at the leaſt, when wee haue patiently endured them, drawe vs from out this heauie yoke. The guiltie perſon, condemned to die, conceiueth no greater diſquietnes in his minde, then to thinke of that kinde of puniſhment, which ſhall take away his life from him. Ah then, take him away, take him away, I beſeech you, out of this world, who can doe nothing but caſt forth complaints and laments, and whoſe importunate voice, peſtereth without interceſſion both heauen and earth, calling ſtill to minde the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without number, which he is forced ouermuch to beare. But I ſee I muſt yet lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſomewhat longer, if ſo, what remedie, but compeld content?</p>
               <p>Let me then languiſh thus, and pine away, and let mine vſuall ſorrowfull tune, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue my dayes, euen vnto my very graue, to the ende, that ſo bewailing my croſſe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I may at laſt giue vp my wearied Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But I ſee deare Father, I doe but trouble thee, and therefore in reſpect of thee, I will giue ouer this mournefull melodie, onely I will recite vnto thee an anſwere of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine falſe <hi>Ecco,</hi> who not long ſince decciued my hopefull expectation. And thus it was.</p>

               <p>See (my good Father) the coſoning hope, that the Goddes of the Forreſts beſtowed vpon me, or rather to ſay more truly, abuſed my wretched life. O notable falſe &amp; deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Oracles of the Gods, as <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> and others may well teſtifie the ſame. But why ſhould men be condemned for deceiuing one another, when they are coſoned by the Gods themſelues? Long time, did I hope well of this mine anſwere, but in the end I found it had deluded my conceit, by which my ſorrow encreaſed not a little the more. Alacke, if it be ſo, that I am altogether vnworthie of this good, why then ſhould the Gods thus promiſe me the ſame? He that hopeth for nothing, languiſheth but little, but hope, deferred, moſt mortally afflicteth the ſoule. Beſides, I haue (long ſince that time) found by experience, not ſmally to my coſt, that the will of the Gods, is called backe, either by reaſon of our ſinnes, or for our vertues ſake. Becauſe of our ſinnes, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and blot out the good entended vnto vs, perceiuing that our faults, make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of them: and for our vertues, they call backe their cruell executioners, finding vs to be worthy of grace, for that we repent vs. And certainely, I belieue they pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the beſt for me, but my default afterward, made me vnmeete to enioy the benefit of their ſentence, which they haue now raced out, and out quite in peeces, continuing ſtill my misfortune againſt me. But I commit all vnto their graue and ſecret prouidence. Meane ſpace, heare I pray you the firſt borne ſong of my wailing Muſe, ſince my firſt arriuall into this darkeſome tabernacle.

But if my verſe, runne not ſmoothly, excuſe I beſeech you mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, from whence, the diſcontinuance, for want of exerciſe, hath reft (what was beſt before) from her. I commend thee Sonne (replied the old man) the matter whereof, not being (in my minde) altogether vnſauorie. But to what purpoſe doth the Louer ſing, being diſioynd, far off from his Miſtris? Songs &amp; Dances, were appointed (long agone) to be vſed, in certaine ſolemne publike Feaſtes, onely to breed contentment and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not to increaſe ſorrow,<note place="margin">A Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> as are theſe of Louers. For I account that ſicke man but a ſot, who through bad medicines, nouriſheth his diſeaſe the more; and for that he will not looſe the remembrance thereof, taketh a toy to continue the ſame ſtill in his body. And ſo I eſteeme that Louer but fooliſh, that encreaſeth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuming cares, by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate complaints and ſighing Sonnets: For ſuch kind of fuell, doth but encreaſe the fire: The onely forgetting of griefe, being that, which deliuereth vs from the ſame; Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as thoſe, that neuer thinke of their hurt, are ſooneſt freed from the apprehenſion and feeling of the harme it ſelfe. (Father) anſwered the Shepheard) can it be, that the fettered priſoner, (bound and laden with chaines, and caſt into a deepe dungeon) ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15406:20"/>exempt himſelfe, from thinking of his helliſh ſeruitude? Or can the eyes, ſee any thing that is ſupernaturall, and yet neuer loue it, nor once as much as thinke of it? This is for bruite beaſtes to doe, and not for man, who being beautified with the knowledge of all things, cannot eſcape without the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of ſuch, as are moſt like to him, &amp; touch him nigheſt. Either he muſt bring himſelf vnto this point, in deſpite of his wil, or elſe he muſt needes fall out of his right witts. But we will not now diſpute, whether fooles, free from apprehenſions, humane, and void of ſence of any euill, are to be thought more happie, then laudable, or allowable. But we will come vnto the Songs of Louers, which are two waies profitable vnto them. The one, becauſe of the comfort which they bring vnto their mindes; the other, by reaſon of the pleaſure, which their Ladies take in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame, who by nature are giuen to be greedie of honourable praiſe. For although theſe kind of Sonnets yeeld forth, a heauie, and not a ioyfull ſound, yet in ſome ſort, doe they ſeeme to accord, and to haue a kind of affinitie, and agreement with thoſe that ſing them; as well, in reſpect that they be ſad and mournfull, as their Maiſters themſelues are; As alſo, becauſe they renew afreſh, the memorie of their ſweete Miſtreſſes. We muſt then (quoth the old man) change this name of Sonet, into wofull ſorrowing, although in this wiſe to lament for the griefes of Louers, doth leſſen the ſame no more, then the pittious cries of the poore Bond-ſlaue doth helpe him, in importuning the aire with his continuall howlings. This Rocke, which thou ſeeſt without ceaſing, to weepe vpon the Mountaine <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> doth teach vs, that teares are vnneceſſarie, and weeping without profit; for his continuall teares doe no good vnto him, nor his vſuall weeping auaile him ought, which diſtilleth, without any profit at all.</p>
               <p>The ancient Sages, ieſted at thoſe faint-hearted &amp; white-liuered men, that vſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their diſaſters, becauſe a right couragious minde indeede, will rather die, then be forced to weepe one drop, it being in the libertie of man, to ſhorten and to out off either his griefes, or his life, as beſt him liketh. And I againe (replied the Shepheard) imagine quite contrarie, eſteeming it not to be any exployt, either of honour or vertue, of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or Magnanimitie, for a man in miſerie to kill himſelfe. For if vertue, proceedeth from patience, (as it doth indeede) and that one be borne, to endure the croſſes and troubles of this world, why then will you repute him to be valorous, who for want of conſtancie to endure theſe bitter brunts, goeth about to maſſacre himſelfe. The leaſt anguiſh of the heart which men feele, ſeemes as forcible in the tempeſt thereof, as the panges of death, &amp; he that with a Magnanimious, and couragious ſpirit, and by the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, reſiſteth not the violent aſſaults, of his inward &amp; outward paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, can be reputed no other but a coward, and not ſeemely to be regiſtred in the Chronicles of honour. All the actions of our mind, if not tempered and husbanded by reaſon, doe preſently mutinie, againſt the faculties and noble empire of the body, forſaking their obedience, making miſerie of that, was inſtituted for mankind: and ſo bearing vp their violence, againſt the ſupreme power of the ſoule, they combat againſt vertue, vnder the enſigne of vice, &amp; neuer ſee the deformitie of her colours, vnder who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſerue. If <hi>Cato</hi> had ſuruiued, valiantly encountring with his hard fortune, oppoſing himſelfe, withall the vtmoſt of his power, againſt the dammage of the Romane common-wealth; Had he not bin far more commended, then for want of courage to haue ſlaine himſelfe ſo time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly as he did.</p>
               <p>Indeed, he wrought his own happines, as he thought, but this his happines, becauſe it was hatefull vnto his owne natiue countrie, ought rather to haue bin counted vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then any felicitie at all: for where the publique good is extended, not any man there ſhould ſeeke his owne particular quiet, but rather moſt cheerfully endure the ſelfeſame torment, with which his countrie is afflicted. But, O how worthy of all praiſe are ſuch, who as reſolute Saylors, ſhew like courage and cheere, as well in aduerſitie as in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, being euery way throughly armed, and reſolued to abide the very ſhocke &amp; puſh of fortune, not looſing their ſpirits or ſtomacks any thing at all, at the firſt arriuall of the ſame, but rather are the more ſtrengthened and animated thereby, yeelding through their inuincible patience, infinit rich teſtimonies of a moſt perfect and obſolute ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue indeed? Amongſt which number, wel may Louers be admitted, who being at libertie to kill themſelues (as infamous, and degenerate mindes doe) and hauing the ſelfe ſame
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15406:21"/>meanes and excuſes that they haue;) yet will not perpetrate nor put in practiſe, ſo vile and horrible a fact; to the ende, they may the better ſhew the fruites of their conſtancie, and perptuall vertue, in all places whereſoeuer they ſhall chaunce to come. For as he is not excuſeable from blame, who becauſe he cannot be good, therefore giueth himſelfe to what is bad, inaſmuch, as (herein) it is our parts, to force our nature it ſelfe. No more is he to be commended, who, for that he can no longer bandie with his afflictions, and with the painefull labours of this world, maketh away his owne ſelfe; becauſe we being the creatures of God, are bound to take part of all ſuch ſiniſter accidents, as it ſhall pleaſe him to ſend vpon vs, without ſhaking off the ſame from vs, by deſtroying our ſelues; which the diuine lawe forbiddeth vs to doe: As that of the ciuill, prohibiteth Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues to flie from the hands of their Lords and Maiſters.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> They therefore, are more to <hi rend="margQuotes">be commended, who ſuffer and ſigh forth their griefes, then thoſe, who becauſe they want force to reſiſt the violence therof, ſlay themſelues;</hi> For vertue ſhineth moſt, amidſt hard and difficult matters, no glory at all harbouring amongſt baſe and abiect ſpirits. Whats that you ſay (anſwered the old man?) Tell me I pray you, is there any thing more ſweet, or deerer vnto man then life? What can make him more renowmed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looſe that, which he holdeth moſt deareſt, to follow vertue, and to doe nothing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his owne honour? And if your ſpeech were true, then, O yee braue martiall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Captaines of warre, moſt miſerable, and far from glory are you, who for the publique benefit and good, amongſt thouſand battailes, haue yeelded forth your blood and ſoules together.

If they had bin ſuch diligent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers of their liues, when for feare of looſing the ſame, they ſhould haue left behind them, millions of vertuous ſtratagems, being the children of praiſe, &amp; Fathers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths; in the enterpriſing of which, they ſtand in perill of their moſt pretious liues. A great credit is it for a man to giue ouer all deſire of riches, of greatneſſe, of all pompe and eſtate, and to depriue himſelfe, of all delicate and delitious kind of liuing; but far greater commendation is it vnto him, to abandon all theſe foreſaid pleaſures, to follow vertue in queſt, and to giue ouer that, which is more neare vnto vs, then all theſe worldly felicities, I meane, our ſweet life; for not to be borne at all, is the greateſt ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that can commonly happen vnto men: as to haue life, is the ſweeteſt and moſt comfortableſt thing,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> that can be imagined. That it is happines to be borne, and to liue in this world, I denie (ſaid the Shepheard) for how bleſſed had it bin, and far better for many a one, neuer to haue taſted of this life at all, as by their luckleſſe endes hath well appeared? Life is good, and pleaſant, to ſuch as know how to vſe it well, but moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto others; for the ende of euery action, doth crowne and make perfect the ſame: and no man is ſaid rightly to be fortunate, vntill his death be come. What happie, good, or vertuous ende, can ſuch make, who haue alwaies liued moſt vngodly, when by being ſo borne, they become moſt wicked ſinners, being continually troubled in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which like a worme, ſtill gnaweth their ſoules? whereas thoſe that liue well and iuſtly, and whoſe behauiour is holy and vnſpotted, make moſt happie endes. I ſay therefore, euery mans birth is not happie, but rather that it is oft times more miſerable vnto ſome men, then pleaſant or fortunate: for better were it for ſuch a one neuer to be at all, then to be borne, and ſo to looſe his ſoule and glory, his name and memorie, through his leaude and wretched miſdemenor.<note place="margin">An example.</note> The Spartans (far wiſer then we) were of mine aduiſe, who made ſo light account of life, as the leaſt naturall imperfection that their children brought with them into this world, was the cauſe they threw them into their common ſhore, or priuies, thereby taking from them their humane eſſence, and their liues. How many miſerable wretches ſhall a man find in this world, to liue in ſuch extremitie and want, as they wiſh they neuer had bin borne, deſiring nothing ſo much as to haue their daies abridged and out off, and to lie full low in their quiet graues? Therefore to be borne, and to liue in this world, are not ſuch pretious things as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them, but rather moſt grieuous and troubleſome: ſo as a man, comming to looſe the ſame, looſeth no great matter; Vertue being his pledge for ſo ſmall a loſſe. Neither will I denie the worthy deedes which the vertuous bring to paſſe, they not ſtanding any thing at all in feare to looſe their liues: and yet the very ſelfe-ſame conſideration, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15406:21"/>maketh them eſteme ſo little of their health, witneſſe ſufficiently enough, that it is not prized by them at any high rate, ſeeing they are content to exchange it for death. If the good <hi>Iob,</hi> (before he had ſuffered what he did) had ended his life, he then had bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of that prayſe, which his rare patience, purchaſed vnto him,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> as we finde in the ſacred Scriptures. And yet (quoth the old man) what good did all theſe complaints vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iob,</hi> which he ſo often repeated in his miſeries, they not being any thing leſſened or aſſwaged by the ſame? And ſo, to begin where we firſt left: What auaileth the miſerable to lament? For more is he to be commended, that with diſcretion concealeth his greife, and with milde conſtancie, beareth out the ſame, then he that maketh proclamation of it by wailing, bewraieth it by ſighing, and by his condoling, maketh it more apparant euery way. Not ſo neither (replied the Shepheard) but rather it is quite contrarie:<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> For is not that ſick patient to be noted for vnwiſe, who will not diſcloſe vnto his Phiſition the cauſe of his diſeaſe, but perſiſting moſt obſtinately, rather to feele the pangs of death, then to declare where his griefe is? And ſo hee, that manifeſteth his ſorrowes by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, receiueth ſome kinde of conſolation, if not preſent remedie. For as the ſmall droppes of water, falling by little and little vpon the harde Rocke, in time, doe make it hollow; So likewiſe the hearts of women, be they neuer ſo ſtronglie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the ſplints of Steele, and Adamant: yet in the ende they will waxe tender and ſoft, as the harde Iron is made to bowe, by the ſtroke of the hammer. Beſides, oftentimes the peruerſe Iudge doth Iuſtice rightlie, through verie importunitie, which by no other meanes, he could euer haue bene brought to haue done. It is a thing that I haue ſeene Louers ordinarily put in practiſe; of whom the paſſions are ſo violent, as they haue not bene able, nether to conceale nor to reſtraine them within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they haue moſt coueted to doe the ſame? I my ſelfe haue made tryall of this remedie, haue paſſed this ſtraight, ventured this hazard, and in concluſion, haue found to haue done good of it. In witneſſe whereof, I beſeech you, once more to giue me the hearing of another of my paſſionate Sonnets. With right good will (anſwered the old man) vpon condition, that thou wilt promiſe me afterward, to vnwinde the Bothome of thy Loues threed. Wherevppon the Shepheard began to ſing in this ſort.</p>

Alas, that the ſeparation of the ſoule, from a faire body, ſhould be far more pleaſing, then that of two loyall harts, moſt ſtricklie chained, with the ſtrong bond of faithfull loue; for with this firſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the remembrance of all greife and doller paſſeth away, like a flaſh of lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that is ſodenly come and gone. But alack, how long are the ſorrowes, how weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome the troubles, &amp; how vnſupportable the miſeries that the ſeparation of his Miſtris, bringeth vnto the wretched Louers? Poore <hi>Oenone,</hi> too well knoweſt thou this to be true, who diddeſt die for verie heauines, becauſe thou wert diſioyned and withheld from thy deere <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death it ſelfe is more welcome vnto Louers, then the long abſence of their Ladies, and yet dare they not die, becauſe they feare their diſpleaſures: which (when they goe about to free themſelues from this bondage) ſnatcheth the weapon out of their hands, whileſt the hope which they conceiued once to behold them, delayeth from day to day the execution of this cruell arreſt of death,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> being ſo profitable vnto all Louers. That traueller findeth himſelfe in great perplexitie, and is not a little penſiue and angrie, who after he hath iournied all the day long, by the comfortable light of the Sunne, is conſtrained to wander in the darke all the night after. For as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth out of bad into good, is luckie, ſweete, and fortunate; ſo harde and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome is the loſſe of ioy, to enter from thence into miſerie, and as it were into the verie gates of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And as mortall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſiſt not from offering ſacrifice vnto the Gods, although they be far off from their ſacred preſence; So my deere and diuine <hi>Diana,</hi> though my fortune hath remoued me far from thy beautious ſight, yet will I not leaue to dedicate all my writings vnto thee, to preſent my ſighes vnto thee, and to render thouſand pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oblations of my teares, as vnto my chiefe Goddeſſe, whoſe I whollie am; my ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, my cries, and my complaints, ſhall all be addreſſed vnto thee. O faire <hi>Diana,</hi> in what place ſoeuer thou now diſplaieſt forth thy radiant beames, doe not I beſech thee, deſpiſe the ſlender vowes of the religious votary, who liuing only through thee, oweth vnto thee, both his labors and his life.</p>
               <p>How wiſelie haue the learned ſet downe, that the onely preſence of the Diuine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, bringeth all contentment that may be, vnto thoſe bleſſed ſpirits that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the ſame, ſeeing the onely countenance of my Miſtris, brought my ſoule to be happie, and ſatisfied mine eyes at full, with perfect ioy? I now excuſe you, O yee leane and yet rich couetous churles, who content your minds with often gazing vpon your ruſtie old gold; becauſe there is nothing comparable vnto that pleaſure, which the ſight bringeth vnto the ſoule, in reſpect of that thing which ſo much delighteth him.</p>
               <p>And who then with reaſon may blame me to loue ſo faire a Iewell, ſeeing beautie, is found to be a gift come from God, made onely to render himſelfe the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in the eyes of the world? Who can iuſtlie finde fault with that man, that ſhall loue a thing rare, perfect, and ſurpaſſing in perfection, ſuch as are ordinarie and common? So likewiſe, who can rightly condemne men for honoring ſuch a one, as beautie her ſelfe, yeeldeth a moſt excellent perfection, amongſt thoſe that are moſt perfect of all?</p>
               <p>Then thee O <hi>Diana</hi> doe I honor: thee doe I loue: thee do I reſpect: ſorrowing alway for the want of thee: and whilſt my vital blood ſhall boyle within my veines, will I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee: as long as my bones ſhall be ioyned vnto this fleſh, will I reuerence thee:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15406:22"/>as long as my ſoule ſhall be martyred within this bodie, will I dutiouſly regard thee, bewailing thy loſſe, whilſt I ſhall haue libertie to breath, and to be able to make ſenſible things gentle, giue eare vnto my complaints. But I ſee (reuerend Sire) that I doe but wearie thee, and trouble thine eares ouermuch, to importune them with theſe pittious diſcourſes of my hard fortune; now therefore will I change my note, reſoluing to doe, what it ſhall pleaſe thee to command me. Yet before we proceede any further, ſpare me I pray thee, ſo much leiſure, as to heare a Sonet of mine, which (I, being depriued of my Ladie, caſt off, and quite left of mortall men, &amp; cleane for gotten of ſuch as haue bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto me) my ſad or rather colericke Muſe endited for me, whilſt I wandered vp and downe this darkeſome Forreſt.

               <p>See (Shepheard) quoth the old man) if this Sonnet hath as yet any ſmacke of this gallant heate, which en flameth youthfull ſpirits with the hot cinders of glory. And if my Muſe, ſhall ſo much vouchſafe, as to fauour me, with ſome ſmall conceit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie my trembling old age, which although ſhe doe not, and that my verſes be rude and ill ſhapen: yet of this, I am well aſſured, that the Subiect is both good and true. For how (O Shepheard,) can heauens and earth continue without Loue? If the Gods ſhould fall at variance, and Loue ſhould be driuen away from them, who then, during this confuſed diſſenſion, and tempeſtuous hurly-burly, ſhould guide the courſe of the heauens, and giue order about the gouernment of terreſtiall matters? What good rule and order, and what vpright Iuſtice or policie, is there found in that cittie,<note place="margin">An example.</note> wherein the Magiſtrates are at variance, diuided into factions, and quite diſcrepant in opinions? No no, Loue of neceſſitie muſt liue amongſt the Gods, to the ende he may maintaine vnion, amitie and friendſhip one with the other; he giuing directions as well for diuine, as earthly buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>Father (anſwered the Shepheard,) this queſtion of thine is verie eaſilie reſolued, and thou as quickly to be contented, and ſatsfied in this poynt: There is no neede at all, to haue the companie of Loue, in the heauens, to be as an aſſiſtance or helper, in the maintaining and gouerning of celeſtiall cauſes: ſeeing amongſt vs, there is but one God, whoſe onely diuine prouidence alone, ruleth both heauen and earth, he being not diſvnited at all; for it is a Subſtance ſimple, not ſubiect vnto diuiſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath nothing to doe with Loue, to bring him to agreement, ſeeing he can neuer be diuided. And this is for the auncient Paynims to diſcourſe vpon theſe naturall reaſons.</p>
               <p>God then,<note place="margin">A ſimilie.</note> doth not meddle, nor hath not to deale with this Loue (I meane ſuch as is wanton) but dearely doth he affect perfect amitie, inaſmuch as he loueth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which are his children, he demaunding the ſelfe-ſame loue of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>The Soueraigne Magiſtrate, vpon whoſe commaundements, the gouernment of the whole cittie dependeth, cannot be at controuerſie with his Subiects about the ordering thereof, (becauſe they doe not participate with his power) he himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding alone, by his abſolute will and authoritie.</p>
               <p>So God, being without equall, and onely perfectly puiſſaunt, and mightie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall at ſquare with any of his ſeruants; which thing if it be ſo, he then hath no neede of Loue to make them agree together againe.</p>
               <p>Thy reaſon is (good replied the old man) in reſpect of that which belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but as concerning men how can they liue without Loue? For if a building cannot remaine firme and ſure without a ſtrong foundation, how then may men continue without Loue? which ſerueth as a fortreſſe, vnto their reſt and pleaſure, and as a chiefe nouriſhment vnto their liues. For can men liue quietly, who are alwaies quarrelling, and as it were at daggers-drawing, and who for want of Loue, are ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſtabbe one another? What aſſurance of life can that ſouldier promiſe vnto himſelfe, who moſt couragiouſly goeth to the field to combat with his enemie, man to man,<note place="margin">An example.</note> alone? Euen ſo, what kind of life ſhould men leade, one with an other, if their quarrells ſhould cauſe them trie their valours with their ſwords, ſtaining the ground with the loſſe of their deareſt blood? For into what bottomleſſe gulfes of misfortune and ouerthrow, did ciuill diſſenſion for want of Loue and friendſhip, bring the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who with their owne proper weapons, reuenged the iniuries and wrongs, they had done vnto forraigne Nations, vpon their owne ſelues, which thoſe barborous ſtrangers, with all their force could neuer haue bin able to haue done? Into what great loſſes and dammages, did the quarrells of the <hi>Spartaines</hi> and the <hi>Atheniaus</hi> plunge all <hi>Greece?</hi> And what monſtrous crueltie (for default of Loue) did thoſe two <hi>Theban</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, exerciſe one againſt the other, who with one ſtroke, ſtabbing one another, and caſt into one, and the ſelfe-ſame fire (ſo mortall was their hatred) as the verie flame thereof diuided it ſelfe, till it conſumed thoſe bodies (which whilſt they liued were diuided) and ſundred in diſagreement alwaies? I ſay therefore, that men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue without amitie, and that the Sonet is falſe in that point: for either Loue muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15406:23"/>yet be liuing, or elſe the world muſt periſh: mortall men muſt be ſwallowed vp, and the earth be left fruitleſſe and barraine.</p>
               <p>Reuerend Father (anſwered the Shepheard) I will make thee a ſhort anſwere, which is, that Friendſhip as thou affirmeſt, is moſt neceſſarie, for man who cannot liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; no more then the fiſh can be without the water: which was the reaſon induced me to ſay, that Loue was dead amongſt them.</p>
               <p>For what doe wee ſee nowe a dayes, but murders, troubles, controuerſies, debates, quarrels, and peruerſe opinions, which after the chaſing away of Amitie, with the ſame whip, haue alſo driuen away men out of the worlde, being rooted out, with continuall brawling and fighting, whilſt they wanted the comfortable ſupport of Frienſhip to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them.</p>
               <p>The golden world of our Forefathers is gone and paſt, and that of Iron is come in his place: ſo that we may truely ſay; All Curteſie, all kindneſſe, all Iuſtice, and all Pietie, are dead and extinct, and ſo by the ſame meanes, the Eſſence of all mortall men muſt needes decay and die.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Gouernour of an Armie Royall, minding to chaunge his place, and to remoue all his Camp, ſendeth his Marſhall of the fielde before,<note place="margin">A Simily.</note> to prouide conuenient lodgings for him. So earthly men, entending to change this field of the world, haue ſent before them (as their Harbinger) milde Amitie, to prouide better dwellings for them in another Climat.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, ſurely, moſt happie art thou, that thine eyes haue bene kept from the viewe of ſo manie miſeries, that thy toung is ſeene to be exempt and free from recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo many miſchiefs, vſually lighting vpon men, and that thine eares are found to be ſhut cloſe from the cryes and complaintes of afflicted perſons, in this moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Age. For amongſt worldlings, fortunate now are Fooles, bleſſed are the blinde, and rightly contented are onely ſuch as be deafe.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake by experience, who moſt miſerably euerie way, haue found ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration and comfort, in theſe my calamities amongſt men, as I perſwade my ſelfe verily, that Friendſhip liueth no more amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Although thy ſpeech (ſayd the olde man) as touching the firſt be found to be true, yet cannot I beleeue, that the like may be prooued in Faith: For I confeſſe, it may be that Amitie peraduenture, is wanting amongſt men, which is the occaſion of ſo manie diſſentions, quarrells, and debates. But I thinke not ſo of Faith, which findeth roome, euen in the ſelfe-ſame place, from whence friendſhip hath bene driuen. As amongſt Warres, Battailes, Combats, and contentions. For thoſe that Diſcord and want of Loue force to arme themſelues, one againſt another, ought not for all that, to faile of their faith: inaſmuch as Faith it ſelfe is requiſite, and required in an Enemie, and becauſe without the ſame, not any iuſt Warre can be waged.</p>
               <p>For it is lawfull for vs to hate our foe, and to perſecute him with anie naked ſword in our hands, but not to deceiue him, with our Faith giuen vnto him: ſeeing nothing ſhould make one to goe from his ſolemne promiſe, except the badde dealings of other men, and the treacherous wrongs, wrought againſt him, by his enemies: which is of force, to make him deteſt and loath.</p>
               <p>With ſuch a Faith the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> waged battaile againſt <hi>Phineus,</hi> whome they aduertiſed of the poyſon, which his Phiſition would haue miniſtred vnto him in a Potion.</p>
               <p>How true of his word, was <hi>Marcus Regulus,</hi> who with the price of his blood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued his Faith, whole, entire, and vnblemiſht? I holde then for a truth, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip liueth no more now adayes amongſt men, but that in his place, warre and diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gouerne and raigne: and yet for all this, I will not graunt that Faith is alſo fled from hence, as the other is, ſeeing ſhe is not onely neceſſarie in time of quietnes, but alſo profitable, during the ſtormes of brawling diſcord.</p>
               <p>But ſhould this miſchiefe happen, that Faith were quite baniſhed away by men, yet cannot I thinke that God would ſuffer ſuch as are the cauſe thereof, to liue one houre, in as much as hee reſerueth the puniſhment of Periurie, to himſelfe alone, and that hee being the Father of <hi>Truth,</hi> the enemies thereof are as much odious vnto
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15406:24"/>him, as the pride of thoſe Giants was, which would haue ſcaled <hi>Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed (quoth the Shepheard) I confeſſe, that heeretofore verie Faith liued amongſt Warres, and warriours, and that ſhee was heartily welcome vnto thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from whence amitie was quite exiled: but the times wax euery day worſe and worſe, men growing more and more in badnes, that firſt ſacred and iuſt Nature of man, being daily ccorrupted, by reaſon of the ſharpnes of vice, as wine becommeth tart and ſower, with ouer-much heat of Sommer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Example.</note> being priſoner vnto a certaine barbarous King, gaue good triall of his Faith, being ſent home vnto his Countrey without ranſome. Loyall and faithfull was <hi>Camillus,</hi> in his warres, who ſent that traiterous Schoole maiſter home, well whipt vnto his foes, whom he had beſieged, whoſe Citie he offered to betray vnto him. But the world is now changed: In ſteed of the Lyon, the Fox wageth battell: whilſt men (as the followers of <hi>Lyſander</hi>) make vſe of their Faith, ſtudying to cozen and deceiue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Vice (in this age) borroweth the place of Vertue,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> receiuing the ſelfe-ſame vowes, and Sacrifices, which before times were offered vnto that ſacred Goddeſſe, they being (by antiquitie) onely ordained for her. In ſteede of Faith, falſe diſloyaltie maketh her ſelfe to be adored: and he is moſt commended, feared, and reſpected, that knoweth beſt, how with ſubtiltie to ouercom others, and hath put in practiſe no ſmall number of baſe and trecherous effects. In times paſt, priſoners taken in Battaile, might (vpon their promiſe giuen) retire,<note place="margin">A diſcourſe againſt vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notable Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> whether they beſt pleaſed, and ſuch great curteſie receiued (by their aduerſaries) they recompenced againe, with a firme and faithfull aſſurance of their word, neuer failing to performe, as much as they had before proteſted. But now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the warrant of their Faith, they will out the throtes (if they can) of ſuch as haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them: and if the ſame Faith hath giuen them ſuch free paſſage, as they may haue leaue to retire themſelues for a certaine time, yet will they neuer returne backe againe, but had rather, that their promiſe ſo pawned, ſhould remaine as priſoner, then their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Carkaſſes ſhould come to be in durance, neuer to be redeemed. Beſides, men haue found now adayes many kindes of ſhiftes, to violate and breake their Faiths, as ſome,<note place="margin">Note.</note> by betraying of their maiſters: others, by ſelling ſuch places of importance, as are committed vnto them in truſt: others, by being (neuer) maiſters of their owne word: and others, faining themſelues, of deadly enemies, to become ſound and deare friends; to the ende, that vnder the colour of this faith, they may the ſooner beguile ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute moſt confidence in them.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore talke no more of Faith. But God who is the reuenger of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and enormities committed againſt him, puniſheth thoſe perſons with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rigor, that there is not ſo much as one of them exempted from publike miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, whereas peace-full quietnes, being the companions of Loue and of Faith, hath followed after them, leauing men in a moſt miſerable plight, and wretched ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: For this is moſt certaine,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> that the wicked languiſh alwayes in miſerie, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in continuall feare, horror and frighting, although they be followed by none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then their owne faults alone.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, how Loue and Faith, are quite expulſed from out the world. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (quoth the olde man) theſe two goodly vertues be driuen from hence, yet ſee I (as yet) no ſufficient ſubiect, by reaſon of which the <hi>Muſes</hi> ſhould be exiled, as thou haſt ſet downe the other be: and therefore in this point thy ſpeech is falſe. For glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious renowme, is a paſſion ſo ſweete, and of ſo pleaſing a taſte, that it maketh herſelfe to be wiſht for, not of the good and vertuous onely, but alſo of ſuch as are Infidels and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: For doe the leaude man neuer ſo badly,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> yet would he willingly be commended for the ſame: Praiſe is a certaine odoriferous ſent in the noſes of men, and an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kinde of thundring in their tickling eares. Haue you euer ſeene creature, were he neuer ſo much corrupted with vice, that would refuſe ſuch glorie as you ſeemed willing to attribute vnto him?<note place="margin">A right Simily.</note> For as euery parent thinketh his owne childe faireſt, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry workman, his owne worke fineſt, euen ſo euery man, be he neuer ſo wicked, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his deedes moſt iuſt, and his actions worthy of moſt praiſe.</p>
               <p>If therefore, both the good and the bad, hunt thus after this glorie, and ſtriue ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15406:24"/>much for praiſe (although the world) at this time be inhabited only with the wicked. And if the ſacred Muſes be of ſo great perfection of themſelues, as they giue ſufficient teſtimony euerie where of the ſame, who then can be able to chaſe them away from men? For much good, can they doe, for the good, in commending their proceedings,<note place="margin">Prayſe of Learning</note> and in animating their courages to follow the ſame ſtill: And much hurt can they doe to the bad, in diſpraiſing their actions, and in diſſwading others to leaue and giue ouer ſuch vndecent, and moſt vnſeemlie faſhions. In good therefore, and in bad, the Muſes ought and may alwaies haue an intereſt, and a perfect continuance, as beſt them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Denis</hi> the Tyrant, loued <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; diuers learned men, haue tendered, ſuccoured, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fauored the Muſes and Learning, and therefore doe they ſtill liue amongſt them. And I am flat of another minde (replied the Shepheard) being of opinion that the Muſes haue neuer had to doe with the wicked, that their fortunes haue not bene like the others, neither their cariage at any time alike. Therefore the Muſes (as things contrarie vnto them) hate them, finging of none, but of the vertuous: whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhunne and deteſt the Muſes, doubting leaſt they ſhould reueale their vices, and reprehend their faults ouermuch.</p>
               <p>The vpright Iudge hateth the high-way Robber, becauſe he troubleth the quietnes of the Countrie, of which his charge maketh him the preſeruer: and the fellon, hateth the good Iudge, becauſe he both knoweth he can and ought to puniſh him for his demir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And ſo is it, betweene the Muſes, and ſuch as are wicked. Neuer hath it bene knowne, that betweene them, there hath bene found any perfect frendſhip (of force ſufficient to haue tyed their hearts ſtronglie together: for if the bad haue at any time made any ſhow of Loue vnto the Muſes, yet no ſooner came they to haue knowledge of their true &amp; iuſt, and of their pure and liberall nature, but that ſodenly, they conceiued againſt them a greater hatred, then if they had neuer bene acquainted with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as two agreeable natures hapning to encounter and vnite themſelues ſo ſtrictlie together, as it is not poſſible for death it ſelfe to ſeparate them aſunder; So likewiſe two contrarie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fronting one againſt another, after they perceiue now much they diſagree, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and loathe one another more, then if there had not bene any habit of acquaintance betweene them before. For although <hi>Denis</hi> loued <hi>Plato,</hi> yet when he vnderſtood of his plainnes, and bold franknes in his ſpeech, and how he abhorred all flattery, he then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him vnto death, ſending him home againe moſt ſhamefullie into <hi>Greece.</hi> So was that worthie Philoſopher <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> hated ſo much of that Tyrant, as nothing could appeaſe and exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is now an ordinarie cuſtome amongſt men, who becauſe they are vicious, therefore they become aduerſaries vnto the Muſes, whoſe diuine and immortall pen they greatly feare. So as I may well ſay, that neither Faith, neither Amitie, nor the Muſes, are now liuing amongſt men.</p>
               <p>To this, the olde man began to replie (when on the ſodaine they might heare a voice, which ſweetly ſighed forth theſe words following. O Loue, and the Sea, alike, and agreeable in power, which force men againſt their wills to take what courſe they beſt pleaſe!</p>
               <p>Loue compelleth to like in deſpight of our owne hart, and the Sea, driueth miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches out of their way, halfe dead, and halfe aliue, which flote on her waues.

But alas, which of theſe twaine, can any mortall creature reſiſt? of both, I geſſe the ſea is beſt able to be encountred withal. For if the Gods tremble at the commandements of Loue, who then, can ſet men free &amp; at libertie from his yoke? whereas the labor and induſtrie of the Marriners, the Maſt, the Rudder, the Cable, and the Ancor, may ſometimes bridle the boldnes of the ſea, and withſtand his raging violence.</p>
               <p>The firſt place into which the ſea maugre my will, threw me, was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I arriued (being driuen by the ſwelling ſurges) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bankes of the deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where I ſawe that thriſe renoumed <hi>Iulietta,</hi> of whom, Loue on the ſoden, forced me to become exceeding amorous: ſince which time, long haue bene my paines, cruell my trauels, &amp; ſcalding hote
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15406:25"/>my cares in this my liking, theſe being the goodlieſt Weapons that Loue hath, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, he is neuer rightly found. All theſe ſorrowes as yet remaine in me, I bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with me into my Ship, inſteed of ſuch pretious Marchandiſe, as the Marchant ladeth his veſſel withall, in a far and forrein Countrie.</p>
               <p>But, O how ſweete vnto Illuſtrious ſpirits, are ſuch trauels as they endure, to purchaſe glorie? For that labor, doe we not call any toyling at all, which we ſuffer for a moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thing, when with the ſame, we may recompence our ſelues for the paines which we haue taken. Sweet and kinde, haue I found the ſorrowes, which the loue I bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed <hi>Iulietta,</hi> hath made me feele? Inaſmuch as the remembrance of her rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſhadowed the thought of my griefs, as a bright burning torch, doth a little ſmall candle.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> For how many are there, that iudge the paine more ſweete and pleaſing which they endure, for the reſpect of ſome worthy ſubiect, then the quiet repoſe, and gentle reſt of their owne ſoules?

The Husbandman calleth not that trauell any labour, which he taketh to ſowe his grounde, becauſe he hopeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reape a good Harueſt. So likewiſe, cannot any one that loueth, terme his traucls any troubles at all, if he endure the ſame for a worthie reſpect, eſpecially hoping to finde ſome grace or fauour in the ende. The Fruites of Loue are ſo delightfull, as the onlie ſent of them alone,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> without any further taſte, extinguiſheth, and cureth the toylings, &amp; turmoyles of Louers.

With Loue may the Louer be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his kinde Lady &amp; miſtris, if ſhe ſo pleaſeth, and therefore moſt happie the paines of Loue. But woe is me, I talke of fortunate Louers, and not of my ſelfe, for without any ſhewe or ſigne, that my loue is cured or healed, am I returned home againe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing with me, but the Image of my fair Saint imprinted in my ſoule, with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſorrowes to accompany the ſame: yet, whereſoeuer the cunning Painter paſſeth, he leaueth ſome ſhowe of his ſkill,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> and euerie famous Poet ſome ſigne of his Muſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.

               <p>As he that is confined within ſome fodorne Ile, quite out of hope, euer to returne vnto his ſweete countrie againe, is not a little moued, ſeeing a ſhip to arriue at his ſhore, which by the language of the paſſengers, he perceiueth to be of his owne countrie. So was <hi>Arcas.</hi> much amazed, hearing one to ſpeake of her, who gaue life vnto his infant writings, whom he honoured as a moſt excellent and exquiſite creature, and who for her vertue, was renowmed throughout all the world. And as forſaken <hi>Ariadnes</hi> being left alone, vpon the durtie ſhore of the Sea, ran vp and downe, beholding a far off in the Ocean, any ſhip that ſeemed to bend his courſe towards her, to vnderſtand ſome good newes from her diſloyall husband: euen ſo did <hi>Arcas</hi> runne here and there to find out him, who ſo often pronounced the name of his deare <hi>Iulietta.</hi> Away went he then to ſeeke this ſtraunger, whom ere long he found, and who, being tired with his ouermuch trauaile, and chillie colde, with lying ſo long vpon the waters, had betaken himſelfe vnto his reſt, being falne into a little ſlumber, loth was he, neither durſt he to awake him, when marking of him better, he might perceiue two tables to lie by him, which ſtraight he called to mind, remembring them to be the faire and true counterfaits of <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Iulietta:</hi> whereupon he thus ſpake ſoftly vnto himſelfe. O happie Painter, that tookeſt in hand ſo laudable a peece of worke as this is. In former ages our prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did conſecrate Statues to ſuch as were valiant, by reaſon their countries were beholding vnto them, but vnto none, more rare perſonages then theſe, could any man giue any, whom theſe pictures doe repreſent. For if vertue hath power to make the vertuous liue in the hearts of men, then with greater reaſon ought ſuch as thoſe, he drawne by the cunning Painter. Ah beautifull counterfaites, how much doe you delight me, and how much is the memorie of thoſe which you preſent, ſweet and pleaſing vnto me? And now I approue and allow, that action of his, who made ſo great a iourney to trauaile to <hi>Rome,</hi> onely to ſee that famous Hiſtoriographer <hi>Liuie:</hi> For much pleaſing vnto the minde is the ſight of excellent creatures. Bleſſed and religious Miniſters of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who to refreſh the memorie of man, (prone by nature to forget,) haue iudged that the pictures of Saints (after they had merited a crowne of eternall glorie, for their ſpotleſſe liuing) were verie neceſſarie, and thought commodious vnto men, to the ende they might be, not worſhipped, yet be admired of euery one: For if with our ſeeing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue corporally, we ſuffer our ſelues ſweetly to be drawne away by her meanes, then how much more ſhould we like of her, ſeeing the very faces, of ſuch as lodge and dwell in her alwaies.</p>

               <p>Ah, would to God, I ſaw as liuely ſhadowed, the faire face of my diuine <hi>Diana,</hi> for then, ſhould I receiue ſome eaſe in theſe my griefes, hauing by me the likeneſſe of her, whoſe abſence, abſenteth and keepeth away the cleere light from my dim eies. But where froward deſtinie ſhooteth her arrowes; there neuer mingleth ſhe ſo much as one ſweete one, amongſt ſo many ſower &amp; venomous ſhafts. Seldome or neuer amongſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill fortune, doth there happen any good chance: for man being driuen away by the worſt, and wholy poſſeſſed of the ſame, as then is wide and vncapable, of feeling or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any pleaſure at all, be it neuer ſo little. Needs then muſt all ſorts of miſeries abound in me, to the end I may haue the more praiſe by reaſon of enduring the ſame; or elſe, far more witneſſes, of the anger of the heauens againſt me, for the more the trauaile is great, the fairer is the glorie, and he that doth participate with dangers, hath likewiſe a part and ſhare in renowne. As he that without intermiſſion feeleth himſelfe to be ſtruck with the piercing darts of heauen, beareth in this world, the puniſhment of his ſinnes. But, O how perfectly doe I ſee painted forth the valour, the braue grace, and the ſweet Maieſtie of <hi>Phillis.</hi> That ſtatue of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> placed vpon his Tombe, as yet is a terror vnto the <hi>Turks,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo often ouercame; And ſo goodly doth this portrature ſeeme vnto me, as me thinkes (yet) I ſee him aliue, whom it reſemb leth: Being comely, wiſe, &amp; valiant, as another Romane <hi>Caeſar.</hi> In the other, ſo liuely ſhadowed, by thoſe daintie flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en haires, by that beautious and large forhead, by thoſe diamond eyes, reſembling two

But to ſet downe with life, the rare qualities of theſe two worthy perſonages, nor Painter, nor Poet, nor any in the world, is able to doe.

               <p>Theſe were the verſes which were written vnder the two pictures, and he that was Maiſter of them, was the hard deſtined <hi>Philiſtel,</hi> the moſt affectionate ſeruant of the faire <hi>Iulietta,</hi> who being preſſed vpon, to returne into his owne natiue ſoyle, was forced much againſt his will, to leaue her, bringing away with her licenſe, theſe two Tables, to the ende he might ſtill contemplate and behold her, as well with the eyes of his bodie, as thoſe of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>And now I maruaile no more of that ſelfe-conceited Painter,<note place="margin">A Hiſtorie.</note> who fell in loue with his owne picture, or of fond <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who grew extreamely enamoured of his owne ſhadow, ſeeing the Shepheard <hi>Arcas,</hi> found the thoughts of his misfortunes to be ſweetely aſſwaged, with the continuall regard of theſe counterfaites gazing vpon them, without mouing a long time: In the meane ſpace, <hi>Philiſtel,</hi> awaked the other Swaine, not perceiuing it at all, hauing now called to mind poore <hi>Arcas,</hi> and how he had bin hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore corriuall in his Loue; and imagining that he was as yet touched with his firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by reaſon his ſenſes were rauiſhed, in ſtaring ſo much vpon the picture of <hi>Iulietta;</hi> to awake him out of his dreame, he began thus to accoſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcas,</hi> the excellencie of beautie, conſiſteth chiefly in this one poynt, which is not to beare enuie vnto thoſe that exerciſe the ſame, but rather to imitate them in what we may, for happie is that countrie which as a thicke and ſhadowing Forreſt, is ſowed, and filled, with a great number of worthie and vertuous men. Thy ſelfe, and I, ſtrooken with one and the ſelfe-ſame dart, haue loued her, whoſe ſhadow thou here ſeeſt, and becauſe this Loue of ours was laudable, yea and worthie of reward, therefore hath it neuer altered our mindes, nor ſeparated our good liking, one from another.</p>
               <p>The Spartaines heretofore loued (but yet chaſtly) the faire and prettie children of their citie, this liking of theirs, neuer breeding any falling out, or iealous conceit,<note place="margin">An example.</note> one againſt another, although three or fower of them loued but one of theſe yongeſt boies alone: But contrariwiſe, they rather forced themſelues, and ſtriued one with another, who ſhould beſt teach theſe youthes, ſome rare qualitie or perfection, whereby they might come to more eſtimation and credit. And ſuch was our loue towards the diuine <hi>Iulietta,</hi> we both hauing loued her, and yet not hated one the other, forcing our ſelues to trie, who could doe beſt, in chaunting abroad her faire vertues, ſeeking ſtill, to render
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15406:27"/>that worthie honour, vnto her perfections, as they of right deſerued. And ſeeing this Loue, did part vs at that time (for a while) aſunder, we ought as now of our owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to reunite our ſelues againe together. For the Maiſter of a ſhip, who hath had but hard fortune, hauing made a bad voyage at ſea, hath neede after his loſſes, to get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the relicks, and remainders of his Shipwracke, and to make account of that which (before this miſchaunce) he would haue diſdained to haue done. And ſo we, if any ſmall conceit ouerpartiall, hath paſſed twixt vs about our Loues, now, at this houre when all is loſt, and that ſcarce we our ſelues, are eſcaped from the crueltie of the waters, let vs forget, and ſorgiue what is paſt, and let the (ioy in that we haue once more met againe before we die) maiſter for a while, this our ouermuch ſadnes. Friendſhip neuer beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her diuine brightnes,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> where aboundance of pleaſures flow; for they hinder vs fro diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame; being the occaſions, that it is not adored according vnto her deſerts. But when affliction and ſorrow approacheth, then doth ſhe beſt appeare, her wholſome effects, as then being moſt priſed and commended. For at ſuch a time, neceſſitie forceth men to haue more neede one of another, then when they are in proſperitie, it being the onely cauſe, that loue ſheweth it ſelfe more liuely, hot, &amp; comfortable. My minde prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated vnto me, the comming into this place, whilſt I not knowing the good and happie meeting, that I ſhould haue here, did murmur againſt the Seas, for caſting me vpon this ſhore: but now I haue found by triall, that humane matters being ordered by diuine prouidence, happen oftentimes contrarie vnto the opinion of men; to the ende, they may know, that in reſpect of God, they are but veſſels of earth, by him ordained for ſhame, and that vnto him onely, appertaineth the diſpoſing of all things.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Philiſtell</hi> (anſwered the Shepheard) of great follie ſhould he be condemned, who finding himſelfe all alone, would imagine to be able to carrie away ſome great victorie amongſt the midſt of a huge number of enemies: For it is not courage, but rather mad furie, for one to vndertake more then he is able to bring to paſſe, inaſmuch, as it is no leſſe vertue to know himſelfe, then to vanquiſh and ouercome his aduerſaries. Theſe conſiderations, are ſufficient to moue me, to extinquiſh all bad conceits, which I might haue conceiued againſt you, about the loue of ſweete <hi>Iulietta:</hi> For could I hope, to haue any recompence of her, whome hard misfortune, wretched pouertie, the malice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a thouſand other hinderances, haue ſet me vp, as it were for a marke, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their deadly arrowes at me? Whereas you, (who to ſerue her, haue left your countrie, and your realme, and who carrie beſides, the auncientnes of your birth, and the greatnes of your race, a braue and generous ſpirit endued with as vnſeemely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) may well hope for that, which I not ſo much as dare to name, or thinke of in my heart. Behold then the cauſe, why I cannot beare any malice vnto thee, as touching that thing, which I iudge my ſelfe vnworthie to poſſeſſe: &amp; which for the ſame cauſe, I reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; adore. For my Loues haue bin but ſhrill Trompets, to ſound the glory, of this faire &amp; ſuperexcellent virgin: my labours, but her Herrolds, to blazen forth in right co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, her rich perfections: and mine amorous trauailes, but loud Chaunters of her rare and diuine vertues. But you my deare <hi>Philiſtell,</hi> eaſilie and ſweetly may you obtaine her good will, by the ſacred bond of Nuptiall hallowed right; Nature hauing made you her equall in blood,<note place="margin">How men ought truely to loue.</note> power, authoritie, credit &amp; command. Diuers waies may a man loue, for in louing, are many effects. Some lay the foundation of their Loue, vpon the weake and feeble ground of pleaſures: Others, vpon that of marriage; but the wiſeſt, place it vpon the inexpugnable Rocke of vertue. Voluptuous loue, paſſeth ſlightly, and lightly away, with the pleaſures themſelues: for we loue no more, that thing, which we haue no more occaſion to vſe, by reaſon we haue drawne from thence all the contentment we deſired. The affection which marriage engendreth, endureth longer, and yet is there oftentimes in the ſame, many contrarieties and diſagreements, betweene the Husband and the Wife: but that liking which is ſetled vpon the firme Rocke of vertue, neuer dieth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the cauſe thereof remaineth euerlaſting: The foundation whereof, can neuer be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrown. With ſuch religious amitie haue I ſought diuine <hi>Iulietta,</hi> yea with ſuch amity, as ſhall neuer die in me, no more then vertue, which is to me, in ſteed of a ſtrong Pillar, and therefore can neuer be remoued. Now if that <hi>Bandite,</hi> may count himſelfe happie; who ſeeth to arriue before him, ſuch as are come to reſtore him vnto his former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15406:27"/>and to bring him home againe into his wiſhed for natiue ſoyle.</p>
               <p>Then may I, ſeeing thee (moſt generous Knight) halfe perſwade my ſelfe, that mine exile beginneth to ende, graunting mee for thine onely ſake, a certaine Truce vnto my ouer-tedious griefes.</p>
               <p>But tell me I beſeech thee, (if too too importunate I be not with thee) what now doth that faire Creature, whoſe likenes thou haſt heere, doth her Vertues ſtill continue, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing to glaunce forth her diuine beames? doeth her Altars as yet ſmoke, with ſo manie Sacrifices which thoſe braue Spirits offered vnto her? and doth her learned vaine, ſigh forth ſuch ſweete verſes, as were wont to Enchaunt and Charme, ſo many thouſands of louely ſoules?</p>
               <p>Ah Shepheard (anſwered <hi>Philistel</hi>) the alteration, and the changing of the Planets,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> change and turne, by the ſelfe-ſame manner, the nature of all creatures, and the courſe of euery mortall thing. The Prince that meaneth to remooue his Court, where hee ſtayes, cauſeth all his houſhold likewiſe to doe the ſame, becauſe they depend whollie vpon his commaund: and ſo are men, ſeruants vnto the will, and powerfull command of the Starres. All things are altered, and quite turned topſie-turuie, in our Deſarts of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

Well doeſt thou know, that ſince that time, wherein men haue left the nature of men, to take vpon them, that of the Wolfe, inueſting themſelues, with both skinne, and conditions of that beaſt, there hath beene no other conceit, nor ſtudie amongſt them, but villanie and miſchiefe: As thoſe that are vertuous, hunt after Glorie, hauing no other thought, but of Honor, which they ſet before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a reward for their labors. The wicked ſort to doe wickedly, put in practiſe and vſe, diuers meanes &amp; deuices. That which they are not able to execute, by plaine force, that doe they performe, through diuelliſh Treaſon. For they hold this generall <hi>Maxime,</hi> as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> that the skin of the Foxe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> muſt couer all that part which the Lyon leaueth bare, and vnhidden: and that ſubtiltie, ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and helpe Force, Rage aſſiſt Valour, and Treaſon ſupport Vertue, at a dead lift. We are now no more of that Humor, which this braue Prince was of, who refuſed to Combat with his enemie, by aduantage or ſubtiltie, for feare leaſt he, ſeeing himſelfe ſo ouercome by chaunce; ſhould once more venture, to trie his Fortune againe, to finde if he could as well be ouercome by Vertue, as by falſe and ſlie Trecherie.</p>
               <p>Deceit at this day, is the chiefe ground of euery mans actions,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> which ſheweth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, that they haue no more acceſſe vnto Vertue, that they make no more account of Glorie, and that nothing which is good, ſhou'd henceforth be looked for, to proceed from them. Thou knoweſt, how <hi>Phillis</hi> hauing courteouſly receiued certaine miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Infidels, to be as his companions with him, and how they, (as iealous of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, and enuious of his vertue, being greedie to enioy his goods, and more deſirous then any way deſeruing, his happie Fortunes) moſt cruellie and damnably ſlue him on the ſodaine, this being the ordinarie death of the valiant, valor it ſelfe, not being able to reſiſt the ſame, they themſelues ſtill venturing where danger alway bideth.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Iuliius Caeſar,</hi> the wonder of the world, was traitetouſly ſlaine,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> whome the bloody hand of <hi>Mars</hi> could neuer ſubdue.</p>
               <p>So dyed <hi>Sertorius,</hi> ſlaine by his owne followers, after he had ſpoyled, and brought to nought the great ſtrength and forces of <hi>Pompey,</hi> of <hi>Metellus,</hi> and of all the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>Thus then wee ſee, that it is the common courſe of the greateſt Conquerours, to die after a ſtraunge manner. And although to make away anie man, in this baſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, it is counted diſhoneſt, cruell, and deteſtable, yet is the ſame accounted of now adayes, in the World, it beeing as an ordinary practiſe, daylie put in vſe, more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15406:28"/>then any other policie. Cuſtome is another nature, and preuenteth ouermuch manie times: for hardly or neuer, can we reclaime a thiefe from ſtealing, although we threaten him neuer ſo much: So men vſing themſelues (as now) to commit Treaſons, will not ſticke to glorie in the ſame (that ſo much) and as it ſeemeth, Deceit was the principall matter, of which they were compact and made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phillis</hi> being dead, his diuine ſiſter would needes follow him, ſhee giuing quite away ſo many daintie and worthy giftes, wherewith ſhe was moſt ſweetly adorned and embeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

Salt teares are onely ſweete vnto her, ſorrowe and heauineſſe, her beſt comforts, and pittious laments, are moſt deare and welcome vnto her.</p>
               <p>Women haue no other weapons (being croſſed by hard deſtinies) then bitter teares, not that they are able* through weeping to remedie their griefes, but becauſe through them, they ſhewe ſignes of their affected mindes and good will towards them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted by vnkind <hi>Fortune,</hi> are the occaſion they lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo much for their ſakes.</p>

               <p>So her drerie <hi>Muſe,</hi> (after his death) addicted her ſelfe vnto nothing elſe, then to bewaile the loſſe of her Brother, ſighing forth thouſands of lamentable verſes, and ſinging mournfull <hi>Anthems</hi> ouer his graue, whilſt ſhee powred forth whole <hi>Oceans</hi> of more then affectionate teares. Of theſe mournfull Ditties, had I great ſtore, but the Tempeſt vpon the Sea, tooke them from me, yet hope I one day, to recall them againe vnto my former memorie, at what time, I meane to make thee partaker of them.</p>
               <p>Not long after my parents deceaſing, and I being called vpon continually, to returne home vnto my people, was forced much againſt my will, to take my leaue of her, for a certaine time, leauing her my heart: in eaſing of which, I brought away this her table. My hope is, ſhortly to returne backe againe, after I haue ſet in good order certaine of mine affaires, of great importance: at what time, if thou ſhalt remaine here, as then I will take thee with me, as I paſſe, to the ende I may reſtore thee vnto thy ſweete Countrey, vnto thy deare acquaintance, and vnto thy louing friends, who remaine not a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie for thine abſence.</p>
               <p>Ah Knight,<note place="margin">An excellent diſcourſe, in praiſe of a Contemplatiue kinde of life.</note> (anſwered the Shepheard) what need hath he that is reſolued to die, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring himſelfe from the companie of men, to returne into their ſocietie againe?</p>
               <p>What need of a Chyrurgian had <hi>Cato,</hi> when after he had wounded himſelfe, hee was determined with himſelfe to die. Next after the dead, are men onely happie, who as theſe that are dead vnto the world, neuer vſe to frequent the world more.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing thou thy ſelfe confeſſeſt, that Vice doeth raigne and rage amongſt men, why ſhouldeſt thou enuie at this ſmall parcell of contentment, which mine Exile yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me, tumbling me downe (as it were) from the very height and toppe of the ſame?</p>
               <p>The right happineſſe of man, doth not conſiſt in greatnes of Honor, nor in the vaine pleaſures of this world: for how can you terme ſuch accidents to be happie, when they haue no aſſurance of continuing, wherein the chaſe of Vertue is to be followed, without tracing the paths of Vice at all?</p>
               <p>For what trouble can there ariſe vnto a vertuous man? can the loſſe of goods humble him? no, for he hath none. Can the death of children? no, nor that: for hee finding by Vertue, that they were borne to die, vexeth not himſelfe at all, in that they haue payd the debt which they did owe vnto Nature. Can the want of friends? no: for, if he iudge the time to be miſerable, in which we liue, (and as it were, the father of all misfortunes,) he will then think his friends moſt fortunate, to be departed out of this vale of miſery. Can the afflictions of his bodie? neither, for hee knowing the goodlines of vertue, will ſoone find that glory is gotten with patience, and that it is far better to ſuffer for a little while, then to ſee himſelfe mingled with the troupes of vnworthie perſons, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie &amp; good name dieth, euen with their bodies. What then may grieue the vertuous?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15406:28"/>Can the loſſe of his vertue? No, nor that likewiſe. For it being a Treaſure, farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Fortune, and as it were wholly diuine, is not ſubiect vnto anie mortall decaying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Byas</hi> was of the ſame minde, who carrying his learning with him, wiſely affirmed,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> that he bare away all his chiefe wealth with him.</p>
               <p>If then, neither all the ſpitefull deuiſes of enuious <hi>Fortune,</hi> neither all the bloodie cruelties of ſtepdame Nature, can euer force, or offer violence, vnto a vertuous man, what need hath hee at all, to craue ayde of men, or to enter into their ſocietie? when by their vices, they ſhall corrupt his vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diogines</hi> was of mine opinion, who being content with his owne vertue, very boldly refuſed thoſe Magnificall proffers of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. And ſo did <hi>Phocion,</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, Fabritius</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that famous king of the <hi>Epyrotes.</hi> Beſides, what feare of puniſhment for his fault, doeth trouble the wiſe man? what ſodaine apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of loſſes? what frightfulnes of paine? what doubt of death? or what thoughtfull care, for worldly matters to come hereafter? <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> being pounded to death in a morter, ieſted at death. <hi>Socrates,</hi> bought the ſame, and <hi>Plato,</hi> forced his owne ſelfe to take the like. That Rocke that is founded moſt ſtrongly, within the midſt of the Sea, cannot, nor ought once to feare, leaſt the weather-beaten Barks, or Ships, ſhould breake it in peeces; when contrariwiſe, it is the ſame that ſplitteth them in ſunder. Euen ſo, the wiſe man hath no neede to doubt, leaſt the force of any worldly accidents, ſhould carry him away, ſeeing in all his Actions, hee goeth beyond them, and vanquiſheth the puiſſance, both of the <hi>Heauens</hi> and of <hi>Fortune.</hi> But this power hath he not, whilſt he ſhalbe ranging, and running vp and downe amongſt men, ſpoyling himſelfe through their vices, but rather, when he is retired alone by himſelfe, to entertaine vertue, which as now, keepeth and abideth in the woods, ſince ſhee hath bene baniſhed from Townes and Cities.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour <hi>CHRIST,</hi> being to encounter with <hi>Satan,</hi> choſe not a battalion-field, in the magnificall temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> nor in the publike Market-places, of moſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cities, but in a ſolitary and frequentles Deſart, within which, whileſt S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> kept, he neuer ſaw the inceſtuous adulterie of proud <hi>Herod,</hi> nor felt his own head cut off from his ſhoulders, for ſpeaking nothing but the truth. He then, that will be counted wiſe, let him forbeare and flie from Citties, where growe nothing but contentions, and troubles: for ſo did <hi>Ciccro</hi> &amp; <hi>Seneca,</hi> very often lament, becauſe they were drawne from their ſolitary abidings, to be imploied by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, about matters of Eſtate.</p>
               <p>But now, what vice can the wiſe man encounter withall, here in theſe Deſarts, which may be offenſiue vnto his Vertues? Doeth he finde here any Iniuſtice? No: for ſuch as haue nothing to looſe, and offend not the Lawes, haue nothing to doe with a Iudge. Doth he find ambition? no: for pouertie is neuer hated, but rather pittied, then ſpighted. Doth he find murther? no: for vncouth wilderneſſes neuer breed quarrels. Doth he finde falſifying of faith, and lying? no: for here, being nothing to be gained, we need not to make our ſelues rich with lying. Doeth he finde diſloyaltie, or ſubtil trecherie? no, nor that neither. For the deceitfull deuiſes of the wicked, and their aſpiring hopes, to become great, doth not combat with the truth and honeſtie of our contented ſoules. Seeing then, all accidentall cauſes of ſinne, are here preuented, driuen backe, and quite taken away, that may trouble the vertuous, in his quiet reſt, deface his vertue, offer violence vnto his conſtancie, and bring hurt vnto the calme contentment of his owne minde.</p>
               <p>Did euer any ſuch man repent him of what he had done? not any, for of well doing,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> repentance neuer commeth: Repentance beeing one of the moſt ſenſible, ſharpe, and cruelleſt whippes, wherwith men are much ſcourged, becauſe it neuer marcheth alone. without ſhame and great hurt.</p>
               <p>He onely is right bleſſed, who at the very period of his life, and at his laſt gaſpe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth not for any thing that hee hath done, finding himſelfe to haue no more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his former actions paſſed.</p>
               <p>A bleſſed and holy abode then for the wiſe, are theſe harmeleſſe deſarts, which ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all vice, and giue entertainment onely vnto vertue.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:15406:29"/>
               <p>Vnto ſuch a place did that godly Saint, Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> withdraw himſelfe, when he was determined to leaue the world, to followe God: to renounce all vice, to loue vertue, to abiure all ſinne, and to honor pure Innocencie. If onely naturall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions bring men to be miſerable, becauſe the ſucceſſe of naturall things, hapneth much againſt our will: what then contrariwiſe, can make them more happie, then to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the ſame? Of innumerable troubles doeth he diſcharge himſelfe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth himſelfe from the world, and betaketh him to liue in vncoth wilderneſſes: where the mortall cares of worldly matters doeth not trauerſe him, nor the continuall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Common-wealths trouble him, nor the feare of any loſſe diſquiet him at all. That man who of long time before, is prepared for ſome certaine kinde of Exploite, or who long ſince is reſolute, to encounter againſt the ſhocke of Fortune, is farre leſſe miſerable,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> then hee, who without euer dreaming of any ſuch thing, findeth himſelfe (on the ſodaine) entangled within her knottie Nets. Euen ſo, hee that many yeares before, hath wiſely prepared himſelfe, to entertaine Death, calling for it, and as it were, ſtill marching to meete it, findeth the ſame, when it commeth, nothing cruell at all: where on the other ſide, hee that is filled vp to the very throate, and as I may ſay, choaked with delicious pleaſures, ſuffereth moſt vnſpeakeable torments, tormenting and vexing of himſelfe with helliſh griefes, when he (neuer ſo much as thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before) heareth Death knocking hard, at the gate of his heart, to ſeaze vpon him, and to kill him on the ſuddaine. And yet, it is not enough for a man to be wiſe, and vertuous, vnleſſe he learne the skill, how to continue and keepe his prudencie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for to no ende is it to get,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> vnleſſe we can keepe, what wee haue gotten: the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which, is as laudable, as the labor to gaine it, is commendable.</p>
               <p>The onely beſt meanes for a wiſe man, neuer to looſe his vertue and wiſedome, is to ſhunne as neere as he can, the ſubiect of vice, euery occaſion of blame, and all cauſes of ſinne, which may very eaſily be done by him, if he ſhall giue ouer, and winde himſelfe out of the ſubtill ſnares of the world: As S. <hi>Ierom</hi> did, conuerſing &amp; keeping company with wilde beaſtes, who are farre leſſe viciouſly giuen then men. For the perfection of Glory, conſiſteth in the ende of the worke, it beeing no reaſon at all, that that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be commended, who hath but begunne (as it were) to doe well, no more then that Crafts-man ought to be payed for his labor, who doth finiſh and make perfect, but the halfe of the taske he tooke in hand to doe. It is a ſmall matter for a man to be counted for to haue bene wiſe, and not to continue the ſame ſtill; for ſo, better were it, (like <hi>Socrates,</hi>) to haue bene a foole, and viciouſly giuen at firſt, and afterwards, to prooue moſt graue and vertuous.</p>
               <p>Let man then ſeeke the meanes to continue his prudencie, to nouriſh his Wiſedome, and to retaine ſtill his vertue, and then ſhall he be called wiſe indeed, and a moſt happie man, in that hee hath the ende of his life, according vnto the beginning. Not anie one is (in right) to be praiſed, but after his death, becauſe we knowe not, whether it ſhall pleaſe the Almightie, to continue his good grace towards him, of which hee maketh (a ſhewe) vntill his dying day.</p>
               <p>So that if a rich Prince hath neede to demand ayde of a poorer then himſelfe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, then leſſe occaſion hath the wiſe man (who is rightly rich indeed) to requeſt the ſuccors of poore vicious creatures, to doe him any pleaſure. He that needeth not any thing to finiſh the contentment of his life, hath as little cauſe to craue, begge, or intreat the helpe of anie other perſon. The wiſe man then, who is rich in vertues, contented in minde, and rightly happie, hath no neede to ſeeke the companie of men, through which, he can receiue no other good, then diſpleaſure and vnluckineſſe, when he hath enioyed the ſame. All that time which a man liueth, buſied in worldlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, of which, the ſociety and company of men is the occaſion, he cannot truly vaunt to haue had one ſmall whole day of his life particular, and priuate vnto himſelfe, his whole time and yeares being imployed to the publike benefite, whilſt in himſelfe, hee is full of ſorrowe and griefe, deſpite, and waywardnes, but no ſooner is he let looſe from the world, and that he is alone, without being hindered by any perſon, liuing in ſome odde recluſe Deſart or other, but that then his Life, and Time, beginne to be his owne indeed; for then may he boldly diſpoſe of the ſame, according vnto his owne minde,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15406:29"/>hauing no bodie to controll him, but his owne ſelfe. What is ſo pretious in this world, as is our ſweet libertie? The little Bird deſireth rather to die for hunger abroad, as free, and without the cage, rather then to enioy euery daintie thing,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> whilſt ſhe is encloſed within her hatefull priſon. Whilſt we liue amongſt men, we ſhal not only feele our ſelues to be forced to doe againſt our owne minds, but which is worſe, conſtrained to ſubmit our ſelues, vnto the vniuſt commandements of mightie men, being compelled to offer our ſelues as executioners of their moſt wicked deſires.</p>
               <p>For if bondage, may in any thing, be termed ſweet and tollerable, then muſt it be ſuch, as dependeth vpon a iuſt and lawfull Maiſter, vnto whom reaſon is in ſteed of ſelfe-will and deſire: whereas to ſerue &amp; follow, the vniuſt will of a wicked Lord &amp; Soueraigne, is to make himſelfe more wretched, then condemned guiltie creatures are, whom dying, are ſuſpenced from all their paine. But this ſolitarie receptacle in theſe woods, taketh away all theſe ills, remoueth from vs theſe miſeries, hindereth vs of theſe misfortunes, and doth countercheck, all theſe ſower diſaſters. In this wilderneſſe then (to enioy all theſe benefites) doe I deſire to ſpend the ſhort remainder of this my life, that when I am dead, a ſmall peece of ground may ſerue to ſhroud my harmleſſe Carkas: which is the onely cauſe ſweete knight, of the refuſall of thy gentle offer, which thou makeſt vnto me, to returne againe into the world. In requitall of which, I beſeech the immortall Gods, to ſend thee all good fortune, &amp; to make thee as happie and fortunate, towards thy chaſt, diuine, and faire <hi>Iulietta,</hi> as thou thy ſelfe wouldeſt wiſh: whoſe rare vertues haue ſerued for worthie ſubiects, vnto euery braue ſpirit of this our age.

               <p>This ſaid; the Shepheard kept ſilence, when <hi>Philiſtell</hi> thus replied vnto him. In truth (kinde Shepheard) I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chuſe but approue what thou haſt ſpoken, yet are there very few now adaies to be found, that will follow thy counſell. Although I muſt needs tell thee, that he that deuoteth his yeares, and life, vnto the ſeruice of this common wealth, is more to be commended, then that vertuous man, who withdraweth himſelfe to liue priuately and alone, without the companie of men: For herein, he taketh paines but for himſelfe: his firends, nor countrie reaping no commoditie by the ſame. We are not borne, only for our ſelues, but as well for our Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, friends, and parents, who for this cauſe may chalenge a certaine intereſt in vs. <hi>Cincinalus,</hi> and <hi>Fabritius,</hi> two worthie Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, had more reſpect vnto the good of their Citie, then thou, who being choſen &amp; commanded to ſhew their beſt ſeruice for the ſame, moſt ioyfully and willinglie gaue ouer their houſe of pleaſure in the countrie, with all their quiet, eaſe and delights, to follow the dangerous march of tumultuous warres, taking infinite paines therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing.</p>
               <p>If euerie one were of thy humor, what comoditie, profit, or aduantage, ſhould our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſoyle get, by bringing vs forth? good turnes don kindlie, muſt be recompenced with curteſie: which if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not doe by the helpe of Fortune, becauſe we want the meanes, yet ought we, by our ſeruice, to ſhew our affectionate good wills. For the Murtherers, yea the very Homicide, is not ſo much to be deteſted &amp; abhorred, as is the vngratefull wretch.</p>
               <p>How rightly and iuſtlie may that father complaine of his children, who in ſteed of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duties vnto him, and ſuccoring him in his old age, leaue him, being not able to helpe himſelfe, vnto the rage of fortune, &amp; to the vncharitable times of this hard world? <note place="margin">A Similie.</note> Such children, are by the Law depriued of their inheritance. How much more then are we obliged vnto the deuoire and ſeruice of our countrie? For it is our firſt Parent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom, neither our predeceſſors, nor we our ſelues, could euer haue enioyed this life. May that childe, which may ſtand in ſteed to helpe his diſtreſſed Syre, retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe apart vnto his priuate pleaſures, forſaking, and abſenting himſelfe from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permiſſion and leaue? I thinke none will ſay he can. Indeed, I will not denie, but that the liuing in ſolitarie places, and in the ſweete Ayre of the wholeſome countrie, is far more pleaſing, more bleſſed, and more godlie, then that of the cities. But yet in all our actions, we muſt haue this conſideration, that a publike good, is to be preferred
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15406:30"/>before a piruate.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> For the good we doe for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, extendeth vnto the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of many perſons, it being both godly and immortall: whereas that which we doe for our ſelues, dieth with vs, becauſe nothing is found to ſucceed vs, but what ought or ſhould be bound to leaue ſome good memoriall of the ſame, after we are dead and gone.</p>
               <p>Vertue it ſelfe, conſiſteth not alone in leauing the field vnto vice, and in withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe from thence, becauſe ſhe dareth not combat with her. But it is her part, rather patiently and openly to encounter with the ſame: For thoſe are properly ſaid to be without courage in vertue, who dare not offer themſelues before vice, and who flie, in what they may, to auoyd the fight with her. But as the Sunne is diſcerned euen in the thickeſt of the clouds, ſo is vertue perceiued and knowne, although in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of vice. Neither can he be holden for vertuous, that hauing no bad ſubiect to trie himſelfe, withdraweth himſelfe all alone out of the liſtes, becauſe vertue, doth ſpring from danger, and thoſe that wage battaile, carrie away the prize. And ſeeing he cannot be accounted vertuous indeed, but rather faint-hearted, and white-liuered, who for feare to encounter with vice, doth relinquiſh, both the defence of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and of truth it ſelfe. For it is not enough to ſay, that a man is fortunate and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe he is ſo, vnto his owne ſelfe onely, ſeeing he cannot rightly attaine vnto that title, vntill ſuch time as vertue hath firſt brought him home vnto his countrie, by ſuch happie meanes. Nor is he worthy the name of vertuous, who ſeeth vice to call and challenge him vnto the Combat, and yet dareth not for his life, to trie his valour with her. It is not vertue, but rather ſelfe-loue and liking, for one to procure his owne proper eaſe, but when he forſaketh all his pleaſures, to come to reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ue and ſuccour his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, troubled with viciouſnes and diſorders, then is it vertue indeed.</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Hercules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Example.</note> left his owne home; and as a Knight Errant, ventured abroad in the world, he had not left ſuch remembrance of his wonderfull valour as he did, making euery Land and Region acquainted with his honourable exploytes. And therefore he tooke the beſt courſe, ſearching and ſeeking out in euery place, for the enemies of his vertues, to the end he might trie his force with them, making himſelfe glorious by their ouerthrow, rich by their defeit, and as it were immortall, by their fall and deaths.</p>
               <p>The torch which the traueller carrieth in the night, if he lighteth not the ſame to guide him in his way, doth rather hinder him, then helpe him. Euen ſo, vertue is found more hurtfull in a man, then reuerend, and worthie of praiſe, if he doe not employ the ſame for the publicke commoditie of all, and for the foundation and ſtrengthning of his owne glory and renowme.</p>
               <p>A braue man at armes,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> taketh no little pride to be counted valiant, to ſhew his ſtrong limmes, and warlike bodie, yet if he fight not with his foe, neither goeth about to ſhew ſome proofe of his valour; he ſhall not be accounted, neither couragious, nor valiant. No more ſhall he, be eſteemed as vertuous, who withdraweth himſelfe from the ſocietie and fellowſhip of men, to liue priuately and alone, without hauing once dared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with vice, whereby he might giue a ſigne and teſtimonie of his aſſured vertue. <hi>Cato</hi> could haue giuen ouer the <hi>Romane</hi> common-wealth, ſpoyled and corrupted with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſnes, and vilde diſorders,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> if he had would, and might haue addicted himſelfe wholie vnto his eaſe. But he, the more he ſaw, that it had neede of ſtoutnes, and vertue to reſiſt thoſe enormities, the more he expoſed &amp; thruſt himſelfe forward in her quarrell, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe the more reſolutely to take her defence vpon him, and to lay all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon his owne ſhoulders. Whereas on the other ſide, <hi>Lucullus</hi> was to be much diſcommended, who being glutted with voluptuous pleaſures, and poſſeſſed of infinite riches, left all the care of his countrie, to liue without trouble, not ſo much as once to thruſt forth his hand (as it were) to ſaue the common-wealths veſſell, from daungerous Shipwracke.</p>
               <p>And if that Souldiour, which the vniuſt lawe of warre, hath brought to liue as a ſlaue vnder the yoke of a ſtrange maiſter, cannot depart from him, without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and loue,</p>

For force onely bindeth the Slaue, whereas wee are bound, both by Nature &amp; honor, in a more perfect &amp; indiſſoluble chaine, to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in her defence.</p>
               <p>Hath not that Prince iuſt cauſe to be angrie with his Vaſſell, (nay rather,<note place="margin">A ſimilie.</note> may he not worthily put him to death) who leaueth him in his moſt extremitie, when he hath moſt greateſt and moſt dangerous affaires, ſuch as concerne his whole Eſtate &amp; Land, about which, when he ſhould be buſied, he getteth him away, and giueth him quite ouer, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare leaſt he ſhould be put to too much labor, and taking of paines, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is loath to hazard his life, for the ſafetie of his Soueraine? If ſo, then is hee worthie of farre more puniſhment, that doth abandon his Countrey, when it is in moſt miſerie: For offering our bodies vnto her, wee offer but the leaſt dutie that may bee: ſeeing we doe but diſcharge vs of that debt, which is due vnto her, and which, but for a time, we borrowed.</p>
               <p>Of a better minde (O <hi>Codrus</hi>) wert thou, who to ſerue thy Countrey,<note place="margin">An example.</note> wert content to ſacrifice thy ſelfe to death, being willing for the good of thine owne Land, not onely to looſe thy pleaſures, &amp; thine Imperiall Crowne, but alſo thy owne ſweet and Royall ſelfe.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe did <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> merit great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations, who thought it better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch himſelfe, by ſwallowing downe a draught of deadly poiſon, then to draw his ſword againſt his natiue ſoyle.

               <p>For moſt ſeriouſlie ſhall he be puniſhed of God, who hath not employed his calling to ſome good vſe, which was lent vnto him, and as a bad ſeruant, hath hid the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, without profit at all: Inaſmuch as hee ſheweth himſelfe vnthankfull vnto God, yea and deſerueth no goodnes at all, if hee ſhall not make a commoditie of that vertue &amp; good gift, which he hath bountifully giuen vnto him, more then vnto others. Not vnlike vnto him that maketh the world laugh at his follie, who beeing diſeaſed and ſicke, carrieth the remedy of his maladie in his hand, without once taſting or taking the ſame, vnto the benefit of his health.</p>
               <p>In olde time, ſuch as liued as vnprofitable members vnto their Common-wealths, were taxed at a very great Fine, to the end, that if their bodies would doe no ſeruice vnto their Countreyes, yet at the leaſt, their purſes ſhould ſupplie the defects of that fault. For there is no reaſon that we ſhould liue, without beſtowing ſomwhat of our ſubſtance, vnto the reliefe of our Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Such then, as for feare of taking too much paines, for the Common-wealth, and as loath to oppoſe themſelues againſt the abuſes of the ſame, withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues apart, to liue to their owne ſelues, are much to be blamed, and are farre wide from being to be called or accounted vertuous. For it is not a valuable excuſe, to ſay, I cannot doe any good ſeruice, becauſe I am of no account, and reckoning. No, no, this is not enough, we muſt doe as much as we may, to the vttermoſt of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: for many little fagots laide together, make a huge and great Bonfire: At the leaſt, we muſt ſeeke as much as in vs lyeth, to quit the debt we owe.</p>
               <p>But as ſuch ſlothfull men as theſe, are to be condemned, ſo farre more, are ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be hated and deteſted, who ſticke not, as damned Traytors, to conſpire againſt the ſafetie of their natiue ſoyle, raiſing factions in the ſame, conſuming them with ciuill diſſentions, and vtterly ouerthrowing them, with mutinous Seditions. Such vipers as theſe, are borne to the detriment &amp; domage of the Common-wealths, comming of the race of <hi>Tymon</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi> Theſe kinde of men being onely ſuch, as the further they are off from their Countreyes, the more profitable it is for the ſame.</p>
               <p>But amongſt manie children which a good Father bringeth vp, it cannot be choſen, but that ſome one or other of them, muſt be found to be bad:<note place="margin">An example.</note> In as much as the earth it ſelfe, producing many plants, of which, ſome are good, and ſome are badde, doeth likewiſe engender ſuch ſtrange and diuerſe Natures. Yet as ſhee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Gardner, by skill, to ſet and graft his beſt fruites, in ſuch a ſeaſon as he may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15406:31"/>bring them to full maturitie and ripenes, at their fitte time. And they deuiſe how to cut off, and to pluck vp by the roots, ſuch as be ill, &amp; nothing worth. So hath ſhe alſo both ordained rewards, and glorie, for the beſt, and moſt vertuous Natures, in recompence of their worthie and honorable deedes, and ſharpe and ſeuere puniſhments, for ſuch as are badly enclined, to puniſh them, for ſuch leaude faults as they ſhall commit.</p>
               <p>Now, as a King, who is to wage battaile with a ſtrong and puiſſant enemie, hath need of all his Forces to gether, valiantly to giue him the ouerthrowe; So that Realme which perceiueth ſome of her owne proper children, to riſe, and to take Armes againſt her, ſeeking (like the ſonnes of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> to deſtroy their Father) hath great neede of all her good and faithfull iſſue, who at ſuch an extreamity as that is, neither may, nor ought to leaue her naked and alone, becauſe as then, ſuch an one doth as much hurt, that will not ſeeke to hinder this conſpiracie againſt her (and yet is of power to doe it) as hee, that is the firſt Author and motiue of the ſame.</p>
               <p>This time then, will not ſuffer thee (my deare Shepheard) to take thine eaſe (thus) thou muſt returne againe into thine afflicted Countrey, take thy Fortune as ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, participate with her in her miſeries, and ſaile with her in the ſelfe-ſame dangerous voyage.</p>
               <p>For thoſe are knowne to be true friends, that helpe at a dead lift,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> and in greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, becauſe they doe good, without euer hoping for, of any reward.</p>
               <p>Change then thy aduiſe, and like another <hi>Camillus,</hi> returne from thine exile, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon thy Countrey, theſe thy laſt deuoires, &amp; depriue not thy Natiue ſoyle of thy bones, being to be pittied, as much as great <hi>Affrican</hi> was: to the end, that either thou, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried within the bowels of the ſame, thou mayſt leaue a glorious remembrance of thy ſelfe, when thou ſhalt die: Or elſe, that thou offering thy ſeruice vnto her, thou now bindeſt her vnto thee, although all the ſeruices which wee are able to render vnto our Countrey, cannot binde her vnto vs, by reaſon wee are far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thinke not as yet, that thou art (as it were, a dead tronk, which is caſt into the graue) becauſe it is vnprofitable, and to be put to no good vſe: yeelde vnto thy Countrey what good thou canſt, and any braue qualitie thou haſt, to ſtand her in ſteed, beſtowe it cheerfully on her. For in giuing her that which is thine owne, thou ſhalt deſerue as well at her hands, as thoſe who are farre mightier then thy ſelfe; vnto whome the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens haue giuen better meanes to ſuccour their Countryes, then they haue vnto thee: For euery one is diſcharged, after he hath payd what he doeth owe, and hauing perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med what he can, to the vtmoſt of his power. But it is not a ſufficient diſcharge for the bad debtor,<note place="margin">An example.</note> to ſay, he hath nothing, and yet in the meane time, can find wealth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſupplie his own need. Change then thy mind, &amp; take thy iourney with me, and I will thinke my ſelfe fortunate, if I may reſtore thee vnto thy Countrey againe, becauſe of the great want ſhe hath of ſuch of her children, as are good, naturall, faithfull, and valiant: Amongſt which number, I account thee as one of the chiefe.</p>

               <p>He that ſung this, was the Shepheard <hi>Coridon,</hi> whome (as <hi>Arcas</hi>) wilfull baniſhment had brought by chance into this Deſart, and who calling to mind his Loue, ſung this dolefull Dittie: which being ended, and perceiuing <hi>Philiſtell, Arcas,</hi> and the old man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he runneth ſtrait vnto them, and moſt ioyfully ſaluteth them, praying them to heare a certaine wofull hiſtorie: of the truth of which, his owne eyes had bin witneſſes, in this his traualie. Wherupon they graunted his requeſt, and euery one of them taking their places to ſit downe, they began to liſten vnto him moſt attentiuely, when the Shepheard ſpake as followeth.</p>
               <q>The Tragicall ende of chaſt <hi>Floretta.</hi>

               <p>Although the Almightie, through his diuine prouidence, hath moſt prodigally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the ſoule of man, many faire and goodly perfections, making him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to know and vnderſtand euery thing; Neuertheleſſe, if there be not ſome ſtriking motion to awake him, or ſome ſtrange accident to pricke him forward, he remaineth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, as ſenſeleſſe, without ſhewing any effects, of his power and might at all. For a horſe, although he be by nature, quicke, light, and full of life, yet if he be not ſpurred forward well, he will neither runne orderly, nor yet keepe any pace rightly at all. Now the ſharpeſt ſpurres of the ſoule, are Glory, and Loue, being the firſt deuiſers of his actions, and the chiefeſt cauſes of all his enterpriſes. A braue Generall or Commaunder of a field, egged forward with deſire of glory, will with the price of his blood, amidſt thouſand of dangers, in deſpite of all hazards, venture to ſhew a proofe and ſigne of the brauenes of his minde: A witnes wherof, is <hi>Themiſticles,</hi> who was enuious of the glory of <hi>Milliades.</hi> So likewiſe, a Louer will make ſhew of a thouſand proofes of a galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſpirit, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the beſt meanes he can to bring himſelfe in credit with his Miſtreſſe, to the ende he may thereby obtaine the ſooner his deſire.</p>
               <p>And of ſuch inuentious, <hi>Iupiter</hi> is found to be the firſt inuenter. Warre then and Loue, are the two moſt neceſſarie ſpurres for the minde, although they are ſharpe and violent, as a comfortable potion though bitter, to heale the ſickelie body. And when by chaunce, the ſpirit of man is toucht vnto the quicke with theſe two hot ſpurres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal ſee the ſame to diſcouer all her perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; worthy qualities at the full. For when the valiant champions, begin once to loue, then doe they become moſt rare and admirable in their actions, as well, by their valiantnes to get the good will of their Ladies, as alſo becauſe they leſſe eſteeme of their liues, then they haue done heretofore. Of which number were <hi>Hercules, Troylus, Achilles,</hi> &amp; infinities of other more. And if the <hi>Romane</hi> writers ſpeake truely, we find not any braue caualier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Ladie or Miſtris. This being the occaſion, that I haue vſed this little preamble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come vnto my hiſtorie, which is a mixt diſcourſe both of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> For you ſhall vnderſtand, that a certaine Duke of <hi>Banier,</hi> had (not long ſince) a moſt faire and vertuous daughter, but yet moſt vnfortunate, as moſt commonly the vertuous are, becauſe they being enuied for the ſame, alwaies find a number of enemies, to conſpire and worke their ouerthrow. This Princes being of an excellent beautie, her bringing vp, being according vnto her birth, and inſtructed in all conuenient qualities, fit for ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Virgin, grew to be famous and admirable in euery ſtrange countrie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Such one diuine <hi>Caſſandra</hi> was,</l>
                  <l>The Pearle of <hi>Phrigian</hi> land:</l>
                  <l>Her learning ſuch as it did paſſe,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe Sire, it could not vnderſtand.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Diuers forraigne Princes amazed at the renowmed report of this faire Ladie, found themſelues taken with a certaine great deſire to ſee her: amongſt others, was the King of <hi>Danes</hi> ſonne, one, who was young, gallant, and couragious, whoſe chiefe delight was in the ſweet exerciſes of loue. He being driuen by the ſame of this peereleſſe Paragon to paſſe the Seas, and to come vnto the Court of her Father, to ſee her, was receiued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained according vnto the greatnes of his calling, with large teſtimonies of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euery way, on the old Kings ſide, for that he tooke it moſt kindly, that the young Prince vouchſafed in his owne perſon to come and honour him with the noblenes of his preſence.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſeene this Princeſſe, he iudged Fame to be enuious, in that ſhe had not brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad, the halfe part of her perfections, being of conceit, that all ſuch rare qualities as euer haue bin, were all aſſembled and met together in this one bodie: and that Nature hath made this as a ſuperexcellent peece of worke, to bring her ſelfe to be admired and wondered at in the eyes of all men. For the effecting of the ſame,
<q>
                     <l>Thus whilſt the Louer burneth in this flame,</l>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:15406:32"/>
               <p>This cauſed him to think, that ſhe was to be courted with ſome extraordinary meanes, and not with any triuiall or vſuall diſcretion, required in ſuch affaires; Becauſe ſuch May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens as are beautious, both in bodie, and in minde, are not ſo eaſily courted and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with ſuch facilitie as others are: by reaſon, a man findeth nothing to proceed from them, but what is found to be graue, prudent, and of great vnderſtanding and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the meane time, loue daily grew more and more in the young Prince, which was the occaſion he imagined the perfections of his Miſtris, to encreaſe likewiſe in her.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> Such is the ſtrange force of Loue, as it changeth the nature of mens eyes, making them behold blacke for white, forcing them oftentimes, to adore ſuch a one for celeſtiall and diuine, which amongſt others (generally) is of no account.</p>
               <p>But what maruaile is it to ſee him maiſter the eyes of our bodie, if he be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll our very ſoules, as he himſelfe beſt pleaſeth? And herein may Louers be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto ſuch as walke in the night, who can diſcerne nothing, but what pleaſeth their torche to make them ſee. Euen ſo, they eſteeme nothing to be faire, but what their Loue alloweth them to thinke of. So the flame of a fire, the more it ſpreadeth á<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the more it maketh the fuell to burne. And ſo the Prince, the more he found his ſoule to be powred out vpon the beautie of his Lady, the more hee ſtill viewed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, alwayes courting and deuiſing with her, thinking ſtill that hee ſhould finde one new perfection or another in her. Reſembling herein right ſtudents, who the more they reade, the more they are deſirous: becauſe their reading bringeth them ſome new contentment or pleaſure, cauſing them more and more to be rauiſhed with the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wondring at the bottomles depth of diuine Learning. But the young Damſel, who through ſome ſecret and inward motion of her minde, propheſied the end of this Loue to be miſerable, although the beginning ſeemed to be ſweete and goodly, carryed herſelfe herein, as the wiſe husbandman, who commendeth not the day ouermuch,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he ſee the euening to be come, eſpecially, when he ſeeth the Sun riſe too timely, and to burne too hote, at the beginning, which made her hardly to be brought vnto any thing, being the cauſe that mooued him to vſe theſe ſpeeches vnto her, hauing found her one day at conuenienient leiſure.</p>
               <p>Moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Princeſſe, the greateſt contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that a man can wiſh for in this world, is, to ſee his opinion and conceit, confirmed with experience: and he that beleeueth, and ſeeth, the effect of his beliefe to take place, eſteemeth himſelfe thrice Fortunate, as well of the good conceit he hath of his owne ſenſe, as for the pleaſure and contentment he findeth therein, when hee beholdeth his ſoule to be fullie aſſured of that, which hee ſo much, and ſo long deſired. Amongſt the number of which, I may well place my ſelfe, eſteeming my fortune moſt happy, in that I (hauing ſeene you), haue ſeene the effect of my beliefe, &amp; the full aſſurance of mine owne infallible iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: The renowme of your rare vertues, hath driuen me hither, deſirous to vnderſtand, if it were true or no: But I finde it not ſo, becauſe it hath forgotten to ſpeake of you, as you haue deſerued, which parts in you, are farre more commendable, then all the reports that haue as yet bene made of you. And this is the cauſe you ought not to wonder, if I (ſeeing you farre more accompliſhed euery way, then was bruited vnto mee) doe loue, honour, and affect you, as I doe; Seeing that before euer I beheld you, I honoured you deepely in my heart. And if the Gods recompence the pains which mortal men take to viſit them, to receiue their Oracles, and doe anſwere them according vnto their deſires; Then, (deare Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne of my thoughts) I ſhall deſire you, I may not be fruſtrate of the hope which brought me hither, which was to be gratiouſly accounted of, by a faire Princeſſe, like your ſelfe, (who being perfect in all good gifts, cannot I truſt) want neither mercie nor mildnes. And if the iuſt prayers of men, are heard vp to the heauens, though they themſelues are in condition, baſe, and vnworthy to offer the ſame, yet mine, being of an other nature, (in that I craue nothing but what is lawfull and honeſt, ſhould me thinks, be accepted of you.</p>
               <p>Such demands as proceede from a fooliſh and vndecent Amitie,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> are to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, as diſhoneſt and beaſtly: but ſuch as belong vnto a ſacred and vnſpotted Friendſhip, ought to be accounted of, becauſe without <hi>CHASTE LOVE,</hi> both Gods and men quickly periſh. The praier which I moſt humblie deſire to offer
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15406:33"/>vnto you, is to beſeech you to entertaine me as your faithfull ſeruant, to the end, that if my loyall, conſtant, and long ſeruices, may deſerue any merrit, it might pleaſe your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and moſt ſacred Loue, to finde ſome place for me in the ſame; who hath vowed to make you, and onely you, the Queene of mine owne perſon, Royall Crowne &amp; Realme. For this I will be bold to ſay, that if you ſhall grace me ſo much as to beſtowe the Title of ſeruant on me, I will not doubt but to ſhew my ſelfe worthie of ſome reward: in that I thinke,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> hauing once obtained this fauour at your hands, nothing can come impoſſible vnto me. Suffer me (diuine Princes, to enioy ſo rare a name, which ſhall be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto me, then to be Prince of <hi>Dace:</hi> For no Realme, doe I value at ſo high a rate, as I doe your admired beautie.</p>
               <p>The Gods (they ſay) eſteeme moſt, of the pure good wills, of men their creatures, and loue them for the ſame, perceluing themſelues to be loyallie ſerued, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie honored by them. Imitate them, I beſech you, for you can neuer affect or like anie man that loueth you, in that deepe meaſure that I doe, which I alwaies will maintaine with the loſſe of my deareſt blood, againſt all ſuch, as ſhall make ſhew to loue you: And I will dare to auouch, that their deuotion towards you, being farre inferiour vnto mine, doth not merit ſuch, or the like guerdon, as mine of right deſerueth.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, I beſeech you (good Madam) vouchſafe to accept (as a deed of gift) the whole perſon, and the entire poſſeſſions and Realmes of the Prince of <hi>Dace,</hi> who doth not account nor imagine, his famous glorie, nor his good fortunes, to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne valour, or braue exploits, but only on the faithfull ſeruice which he hath vowed vnto you. For far greater honor ſhall it be vnto him to ſerue ſo rare and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite a creature as you are, then to command, and beare ſway, ouer ten thouſand nations, were they neuer ſo generous.</p>
               <p>The young Princes little or nothing moued with theſe ſweete ſpeeches, &amp; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what loth and vnwilling to anger ſo great a Prince, whoſe affection ſhe found to be wonderfull towards her, whoſe procedings ſhe could not much miſlike of, ſeeing they did ſpring from a vertuous and loyall hart: and withall, perceiuing how greatly he was honored by the Duke her father, reſolued with her ſelfe (ſeeing ſhe could not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him) to carrie her ſelfe ſo wiſely, and to giue him ſo polliticke an anſwere, as he ſhould ſcarſe tell what to iudge of the ſame: &amp; that in ſuch ſort, as it ſhould neither make him diſpaire, nor force him to conceiue any great good hope at all: which ſhe deliuered after this maner of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if my weake and ſhallow iudgement were worthie to take place amongſt ſuch as are learned, &amp; could make difference and diſtinction in matters of importance, I ſhould then thinke, that this word of Perfection, is no way proper nor conuenient vnto mortall things: for that which cannot be changed from his firſt Eſſence &amp; Being, his omnipotent power, and almightie authoritie (as God himſelfe) is onely perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, that which is not certaine to reſt, or to keepe as much as the ſpace of one ſhort houre, in one and the-ſelfe ſame forme, becauſe it is ſubiect vnto alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and change,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> it taking after the vncertaine courſe of the Stars, and the chaunces of this world, cannot any way be called perfect. Which ſeeing it is ſo (I beſeech you Sir, vſe not this word, proper vnto God onely) towards her, whoſe faireſt perfections that ſhe hath, is the aſſured knowledge of her owne imperfections. I am noble Prince too baſe a creature, and of too ſmall account to be beloued of you: the Gods loue not any thing but what is rare, and worthie of their frendſhip.</p>
               <p>Princes are Gods here vpon the earth, and ought to imitate them, not ſearching for any thing, but ſuch (as differing from the vulgar conceit of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people) carrieth in it ſelfe ſome excellent particuler grace, and extraordinarie excellencie with it. But theſe worthie qualities wanting in me, what ſhould moue you to caſt ſo great affection and liking vpon me, as you would ſeeme to parſwade me you doe?</p>
               <p>Let me alone I pray you, I pray you let poore <hi>Iuſtinai</hi> alone. Let not her defects be, as a laughing ſtock vnto your youthfull yeares: Nature hath made her wretched enough alreadie, without farther encreaſing of her miſeries, to make her the table talke, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laughter.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſay that your tongue did agree with your hart, and that they two did not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15406:33"/>in affections, you being as willing euery way (as you make ſhew of) to abaſe your greatnes ſo lowe, as to loue me vnfamedly indeed. Yet what aſſurance can you haue of her, who hath no abſolute power ouer her ſelfe, who is vnder the ſubiection and rule of a Father, whoſe commaundement is her will alone?</p>
               <p>A man can neuer get any benefit of a Seruant that hath nothing at all of his owne,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> and whoſe onely good dependeth vpon the pleaſure of his Maiſter. Euen ſuch is my caſe, and ſo fareth it with me, and therefore if you meane to obtaine, what you ſeeme ſo earneſtly to deſire, you were beſt to make ſute vnto him, who hath intereſt ouer me, without whoſe permiſſion and leaue, I neither can, nor ought, to promiſe any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you at all.</p>
               <p>If this be all (anſwered the Prince) and that there is no other let, I doubt not but to haue a good iſſue in the purſute of this my buſines I haue taken in hand, (for I aſſure my ſelfe for certaine) that my Lord, the Duke your Father, will neuer refuſe the alliance of my houſe, nor that we ſhall not be married together. But neitheir his conſent, neither our alliance, no, nor the mariage it ſelfe, will I account of, vnleſſe I haue your owne good will. For what good would it be vnto me, to enioy you as my ſpouſe, when you as my mortall enemie ſhall miſlike the ſame? The conſent of parents, maketh not the marriage, but the amitie and liking of both the parties, who are willing that their two bodies ſhall be bound in ſo inſeparable a bond together, as death it ſelfe, can ſcarce ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. Onely aſſure me of your liking: for as concerning the obtaining of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good will, which I alreadie perſwade my ſelfe of, I will follow it, as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as ſpeedily. And then will I thinke my ſelfe the moſt happieſt Prince in the world.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo ſimple, (anſwered the Ladie) neither ſo voyd of diſcretion, but that I know that a wiſe and dutifull daughter, ought to loue what her Father is willing ſhe ſhould like, not being ignorant how faithfully, loyallie, and dearely, a lawfull and honeſt husband is to be accounted of. This is all, I can as now anſwere you: If you would craue more of me, you muſt pardon me. To talke with my father, you may doe as you pleaſe: In your buſines, I will neither further nor hinder you, you know beſt what you haue to doe. And ſo with your licence, for this time, I will take my leaue.</p>
               <p>The Princes, being departed from him, he ſtrait went vnto her father, with whome he was ſo earneſt and vehement, in ſetting forth his amorous paſſions, as he promiſed him his daughter, aſſuring her vnto him before witnes. Whereupon the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Prince made all the haſt he could to be gone, to the ende he might carrie theſe happie tidings vnto the King his father, and that he might with the more conuenient ſpeed prepare euery thing readie and fit, for ſo worthie and ſo Royall a Marriage.</p>

               <p>The Prince taking his leaue of his faire Miſtris, deliuered theſe verſes fairely written vnto her, who was neither glad nor ſad at his departure, as well for that ſhe was not as yet wounded with the golden darts of that little blind God, as alſo, becauſe ſhe feared (I know not what luckleſſe ende would chaunce in this conſtrained loue vnto her; yet neuertheleſſe, ſhe reſolued to follow the aduiſe of her father, making account, and that very wiſely, whatſoeuer ſhould happen, yet ſhould not ſhe be blamed, nor found to be faultie at all; ſince ſhe did but that ſhe was commaunded by him.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Prince, hauing onely the bare promiſe of the Duke, without being able to get any ſmall graunt at all of his daughter, leaueth the Court of <hi>Bauier,</hi> and ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thorough the Seas with a merrie gale of winde, returneth home to <hi>Denmarke,</hi> where the King his Father, with all the Nobles of his Realme, receiued him with great ioy, they all being maruellous deſirous to ſee their young Prince married, for the hope they had to ſee ſome braue and worthie iſſue to proceed from ſo forward and Princely a Gentleman as he was.</p>
               <p>But as great and Noble perſonages, are the occaſions, either of much good, or of much euill, according vnto ſuch proceedings as they take in hand, euen ſo, marriages oftentimes bring with them, either much happie fortune, or elſe exceeding great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</p>
               <p>There is no ſo happie an encounter,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> as is the chaſt, loyall, and ſacred marriage of two bodies vnited together, with one and the ſelfe-ſame good will. Neither is there any thing ſo miſerable and vnluckie, as that marriage, where nothing but debate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, diſcention, and all other miſchiefes meete together. For the hatred of a ſtranger is in ſome ſort tollerable, becauſe it commeth but now and then; but that of the husband and the wife, is inſupportable, becauſe it is contrarie vnto the nature of marriage, and is continuall and ordinarie. This being the reaſon, that in many countries, the people reiected and deſpiſed marriage: yea euen amongſt Chriſtians, and ſuch as were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, was it had in no account, they maintaining the communitie of wiues, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp the children ſo begotten, of the common and publicke charge.</p>
               <p>But yet as we muſt not giue ouer a ſicke creature, becauſe we perceiue in him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie feeblenes and weakenes throughout his bodie; euen ſo, although we finde certaine defects in marriage, yet ought we not to conclude againſt it, or to condemne it for the ſame. For though we ſee one corrupt member in a ſound body, yet muſt we not commaund to kill the body for the ſame, but rather ſeeke how to cure it: And ſo ſhould we vſe marriage, being both ſacred and iuſt, which if by chaunce it hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imperfections, we muſt ſtudie how to helpe them, ſuch faults being naturally incident vnto all ſorts of creatures.</p>
               <p>But leauing this, let vs come vnto this wiſhed for marriage, which chanced to be the ouerthrow, both of the Prince of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> of the Princes of <hi>Bauiers,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they being in no ſort blame-worthie at all.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Daniſh</hi> young Lord, hauing the conſent of his Father, and all the Nobilitie of his Realme, to goe through with this match, and all things being in a readines for the entertainement and receiuing of his new Bride, he ſendeth certaine of his chiefe Barrons to bring her home into his countrie, they being furniſht at all points with ſixe tall ſhippes, richly ſet out on euery ſide, not wanting any thing for ſo honourable a Conuoy.</p>

The whiſtling windes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan afreſh to bluſter, to rage and take on, and as it were to be mad for very anger.

               <p>No ſweet Muſicke was now heard, nor no ſigne of ioy or pleaſure was amongſt them.

               <p>To whom may I vtter my complaints? of whom may I intreat for comfort? whom may I craue to aſſiſt me? and from whom may I purchaſe to obtaine remedie, for my ſo great griefe, and anguiſh?</p>
               <p>No, I would thinke my Fortune to be maruellous good, if liuing hardly vpon the rootes and fruite within theſe woods, I might be ſure to keepe my Chaſtitie vntainted, and vnpolluted: but who can or will aſſure me of ſuch exceeding fauour? Cruell, &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruell Sea, of thee doe I complaine moſt of all, in that thou haſt caſt mee vpon thy ſhore, and not drowned me: for this doe I complaine of thee more, then for the loſſe of all my friends, caſt away moſt cruelly by thine onely meanes alone.</p>
               <p>Why diddeſt not thou ſend me to death, as thou diddeſt them? and why did I not take the ſame courſe, following them as they did: ſeeing wee were all embarqued in ſhippes alike, and were to paſſe all vnto one place and Countrey?</p>
               <p>Well, well, yet in deſpite of thee, will I ſeeke to die, comforting my ſelfe with this good, in my laſt miſerie, that ſo doing, my body ſhall not be a prey, neither to vicious men, nor to any deformed monſter. Nothing doubting at all, but that ſome one piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man or other, will vouchſafe to burie me after I am dead, and that the ſame earth, from which it came, will not ſticke to accept and receiue it againe into her owne bowels.</p>
               <p>Thus complained the dolefull <hi>Iustina,</hi> diſpairing as it were, of all ſuccour,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> hardly perſwading her ſelfe, and ſcarcely beleeuing that God would euer deliuer her from this wofull eſtate, in which ſhe found her ſelfe, as then to be in.</p>
               <p>But as his power is farre aboue the capacitie of man, ſo doth his ſuccors come quite contrarie vnto the hope and conceit of them, and as it were, by an extraordinarie kinde of meanes.</p>
               <p>For euen then, when the vnfortunate Princeſſe, reſolued within her ſelfe, to make her ſelfe away, behold, ſhee might perceiue a young Gentleman to come towards her, attended on with two ſeruants, whoſe cuſtome was, to walke oftentimes vnto the Sea ſide, for his diſportand pleaſure, his Caſtle being ſeituate, and lying hard by the ſame, vpon the toppe of an high hill.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had hee caſt his eyes vpon the ſorrowfull virgin, but that he thought preſently, ſhe was the hapleſſe remainder of ſome ſhipwrack of the Sea, and the rather, becauſe he ſaw her enuironed and compaſſed round about with dead coarſes; which he perceiuing, ſodainly began to lament the hard hap of this diſpairing Damſell. And as the braueſt and moſt generous mindes are ſooneſt ſubiect to pittie and compaſſion, he reſolued to helpe and ſuccour her in what he could.</p>
               <p>Comming neere vnto her, he might perceiue her moſt pittifully to ſigh for her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, holding her head betweene her hands, which leaned vpon her lappe, and her dropping eyes, looking downe very wiſtly vpon the ground, which was the cauſe ſhee ſaw not the Knight, vntill he was come right before her.</p>
               <p>But now his preſence, comming as he did, bred a new combat within her thoughts, freezing her heart with a nouell feare againe. For whereas before ſhe onely doubted the crueltie of ſome rauenous beaſt: Now ſeeing ſo faire and goodly a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by her, ſhe began to apprehend in her minde, the loſſe of her Honour, which neuertheleſſe, ſhe reſolued to maintaine the ſame, vnto the vttermoſt of her power,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15406:36"/>and to pleade what ſhe could in her owne defence, before hee ſhould ſeaze vpon her as his prey. Wherevpon with a good courage, ſhee flingeth her ſelfe downe at the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mans feete, and with an aſſured confidence (which through his milde countenance, ſhe perſwaded her ſelfe of him, began thus to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>If GOD (moued at laſt, by mine inceſſant prayers, to be gratious vnto me) hath cauſed thee to come hither, to the intent to ſuccour and helpe me, I know then, thou wilt forbeare to diſhonor me. But if not, and that thou art here arriued to worke my vtter ruine and ouerthrowe; Ah then, I beſeech thee, without more adoe, cut off, and ſhorten this my loathed life.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer thou art,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> I beſeech thee remember, that the glorie of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, was greater, in that he vanquiſhed his owne will, preſeruing vntainted and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, the honours of <hi>Darius</hi> daughters, then in conquering <hi>Darius</hi> himſelfe. And thinke that the chaſte continencie of <hi>Scipio,</hi> brought more renowme and fame vnto him, then the defeit and ouerthrowe of <hi>Hanniball:</hi> and that his modeſt behauiour, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed him more faithfull friendes, and ſeruitours, then the triumphing Conqueſt of that huge <hi>Affrica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus (noble Knight) to vanquiſh our enemie, is the gift of Fortune, and not our own proper force,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> but to ſurmount and ouercome our owne ſelues, is a glorie due vnto our ſelues alone, and to none other. Becauſe neither Fortune, neither the aſſiſtance of our friends, haue any intereſt or part herein: for onely from our ſelues it doth proceed, and from none elſe. Whereas contrariwiſe, if thou pleaſe but to call vnto thy minde, thou ſhalt ſoone find, what blame, diſhonor, and diſgrace, the beaſtly and vicious life of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine</hi> of <hi>Pacis,</hi> of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and diuers others, brought them vnto: who becauſe they durſt preſume moſt cruellie, to rauiſh and deflowre illuſtrious and vertuous Ladies, felt the heauy hand of the heauens, to inflict moſt grieuous plagues vpon them.</p>
               <p>So periſhed <hi>Aiax Oillius,</hi> plagued moſt iuſtly, for forcing the ſacred Propheteſſe <hi>Caſſandra.</hi> For more fowle was his fault accounted, and more was he condemned, for abuſing this Virgin, then proud <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was thought cruell, in ſacrificing the milde <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena,</hi> vpon the tombe of his father <hi>Achilles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now thy ſlaue, as <hi>Caſſandra</hi> was his, yet I hope I ſhall not be ſo hardly vſed, as ſhe was by him, leſt the Gods puniſh thee, as ſeuerely as they did <hi>Aiax.</hi> I rather perſwade my ſelfe, that I haue met with another <hi>Alexander</hi> for chaſt contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, &amp; that my hap ſhal be as fortunate, as was that of <hi>Slutinas,</hi> the wife of <hi>Darius.</hi> But if not, &amp; that I am deceiued in mine expectation, yet at the leaſt, ſhew me the fauour, that I may ſucceede <hi>Lucretia</hi> in her fortune, and lend me ſome weapon or other, with which I may open my breſt, and leaue this my life,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> which I haue ſo much and ſo long diſliked. For it is not life, but rather death, for a modeſt woman to liue without good name and fame, ſeeing we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call that life indeed, which neuer dyeth at all, and that is Honor.</p>
               <p>Then worthy Lord, I commit and commend mine into thy hands, it is for this onely, that I ſo much intreat and begge, and not for life. For ſo little doe I account thereof, as I would thinke it time ill ſpent, and worſe imployed, to demaund or deſire the ſame at all.</p>
               <p>The Knight hearing this note, wondred at her beautie, and not a little, at her braue minde, &amp; rare conſtancie. And ſo much was he amazed at her excellent oration, but far more at her vertuous and ſtout reſolution, that in ſteed of hauing her to be his ſlaue and Captiue, he found himſelfe to be ouercome as her priſoner, and to be wounded with her ſweete countenance, and pleaſing behauiour, which was the occaſion hee replyed thus vnto her.</p>
               <p>Faire Gentlewoman, I knowe no beaſt, were it neuer ſo ſauadge, but would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie helpe and aſſiſt you in your miſerie. And feare you then, that any man hath the power, as much as once to offend you? eſpecially, ſuch as haue taken their oaths, and whoſe ordinarie exerciſe extendeth chiefly to conſerue and maintaine the Honour, and welfare of all Ladies and Gentlewomen whatſoeuer?</p>
               <p>My condition bringeth me within the number of ſuch: Heauens onely graunt, that my proceedings, and mine endeuours, may by the fruites thereof, teſtifie the ſame.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15406:36"/>And as for your ſelfe, you neede not doubt of any thing: for I aſſure you, you haue more power to command mee, then Fortune hath giuen me authoritie ouer you.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> In what baſe or abiect ſtate ſoeuer, vertue encounters and enters, ſhe alwaies ſhineth bright, the crueltie of Fortune not being able to darken her beames, nor to oppoſe her ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her diuine cleerneſſe.</p>
               <p>Perſwade your ſelfe then, not onely of your life, but alſo of your Honour, which this my hand ſhall preſerue, againſt all the men in the world, euen vntill the laſt drop of blood in my bodie.</p>
               <p>That priſoner that by myracle hath eſcaped out of priſon,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> is not more glad at the meeting of his deereſt friendes, who are come to conuey him away ſafe and ſure, then this poore Princeſſe was ioyfull, ſeeing her ſelfe throughly aſſured of the ſafetie of her Honor: Inſomuch as ſhee reſolueth to take her Fortune, and to repoſe her ſelfe vpon the promiſe of the Knight: who ſweetly kiſſing her hand, and helping her vp from the ground gentlie, with all curteous ceremonies, and dutious reſpectes that might be, conducteth her, (his attendants following him) vnto his Caſtle, where being arriued, hee deliuered, and recommended her, vnto his owne mother, an aged Ladie, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and entertained her, with the greateſt curteſie and kindneſſe that might be, as if ſhe had bene her daughter.</p>
               <p>So, as ſhe found her ſelfe to be honored and reſpected, as greatly, as if ſhe had bene in the Court of her Father, without being as much as once vrged, or demaunded, any thing that ſhould be occaſion of miſlike vnto her.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus when from Heauens of ſuccour we dispaire,</l>
                  <l>We finde that then they take for vs most care.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So myraculouſly was <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the chaſte deliuered, ſo holie <hi>Suſanna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Example.</note> ſo vertous <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> and many other ſuch. Neither is it without great reaſon, that high <hi>Iehoua</hi> ſhould come for to aſſiſt vs, but euen then, when we haue moſt need, when we are in greateſt extremitie, and when we haue wholly retired our ſelues, from all expectation of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hopes.</p>
               <p>For if we ſhould be deliuered after a humane manner, and by the hands of men, (when we are in exceeding great danger) we then ſhould neuer acknowledge the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and power of GOD, to be ſo mightie and immortall as it is. Neither ſhould we be bound vnto him as we are, when by his onely ſpeciall grace alone, he doth deliuer vs from ſuch infinite troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustina</hi> then, being ſo ſtarngely freed from all dangers, began by little and little, to forget her ſorrow, being (in time) content to receiue ſome comfort and conſolation, in theſe her grieuous miſchaunces, whilſt in the meane while, her faire eyes recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their former attractiue force; her colour, beautie, and grace, reuiuing againe in her, as freſh as euer they were before, hauing caught as Captiue, the heart of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous Hoaſt.</p>
               <p>Valiant <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo was ſlaue to <hi>Briſſeis</hi> Beautie, fought for her, and became her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, with great dutie.</p>
               <p>By which we finde, how profitable Loue is vnto Slaues and Seruants, making them,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> many times, Lords and Commaunders, ouer their owne Maiſters. And ſuch was <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> to <hi>Phedra, Paris</hi> to <hi>Helena, Anthony</hi> to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> with other moe.</p>
               <p>All which, ſheweth a prudent kinde of recompence in Loue, to requite with ſo great an aduantage, ſuch as Fortune hath turned topſie-turuie, and vtterly in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ouerthrowne, in giuing them authoritie, to controll ouer ſuch as are their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes.</p>
               <p>Yet this good which he doeth, is rather to make himſelfe ſeeme admirable, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and diuine, in his power, then for any good will he beareth vnto any man, being for all this, meerely ignorant, and ſtarke blinde, how to finde the meanes through which he may become rightly iuſt, and pittifull indeed.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15406:37"/>
               <p>But leauing <hi>Iustina</hi> for a while, to plucke vp her ſpirits, to take heart at gras againe, and to begin to be as merrie as euer ſhe was: we will returne to the young <hi>Daniſh</hi> Prince, who had now gotten a certaine intelligence, and true knowledge, of his betrothed Spouſes ſhipwrack on the Seas, and as he thought, her vtter ruine and ouerthrow. For one of the companie of their Ships, eſcaping by the benefite of the windes, was driuen back vpon the coaſts of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> by whome he was throughly aſcertained, of the caſting away of his faire Miſtris, and all her Fleete.</p>
               <p>If hope of future things being prolonged and deferred, rendreth the ſoule miſerie and trouble, how much more then doeth <hi>Dispaire</hi> afflict and torment the ſame? The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſaults whereof, this young Prince but too too well felt; hauing loſt that which he eſteemed moſt of in this world, and ſeeing himſelfe quite fruſtrate, and voyde of the onely delightfull hope of his life: Oftentimes went he about to embrue his owne hands with his deereſt bloud, if he bad not bene preuented, and perſwaded to doe otherwiſe: he being of the minde, that it was impoſſible for him to liue, after the loſſe of that, which was the onely occaſion of his life. Nor did hee grieue alone, for all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey did participate with hm in his ſorrow: not ſo much for the death of the Princeſſe, as for to ſee the exceeding paſſions and torments he ſtill endured. For ſo much did hee take on, and ſo impatiently did he beare her loſſe, as not only he forgot the office &amp; the deuoir of a Prince, but alſo of an ordinary poore creature, offering himſelfe through the extremitie of his paſſions, to become the ſpoyle of Fortune, as the moſt miſerable wretch in the world. For all ioy became irkeſome vnto him, all ſtate and pomp, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and odious, and all pleaſure, diſpleaſant and weariſome; his griefe made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his condition, his health, and his welfare.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>So faithfull <hi>Piramus</hi> with griefe was tost,</l>
                  <l>When he had thought his <hi>Thisbe</hi> faire was lost.</l>
               </q>
               <p>His walkes were ſolitarie, his purmenados melancholie, and the ſauage beaſts of the woods, his onely companie. How often would hee ſit roaring, within the bowells of ſome hollow Rocke or other, and complaine him in the ſhadie deſarts of his too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſaſters?</p>
               <p>How often would he runne vnto the ſhore ſide, looking here and there (like <hi>Ariadnne</hi>) to ſee if the ſelfe-ſame Ship in which his Ladie was imbarked, would appeare vnto his ſight, or no? yet could he ſee nothing, but the ſoming ſurges of the Sea, and the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling billowes, beating on the bankes too and fro. All the newes that he could vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, was the loſſe of his Miſtris, for that was the generall brute that ranne for currant throughout all the Countrey. One while he condemned his ouerraſh fondnes (as wán<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aduiſe and diſcretion) in that, through the ſame, he had hazarded vpon the vngen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle waues, ſo faire and ſweete a Creature, as ſhe was. Another while, he acknowledged and confeſſed himſelfe to be the author of her death, and the cauſe of her deſtruction. Whileſt this opinion of his, drewe whole floods of teares from his eyes, thouſands of ſighes from his heart, and millions of heauie complaints from his ſoule. Two cruell conceits did alwayes afflict him; the one, was the loſſe of his Loue; the other, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant beliefe, that he had bene the occaſion of her vtter ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>Commonly we beare with more patience the misfortune which hapneth vntovs,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> by the deſpitefull malice of the angrie Stars, then we doe that, which through our owne default doth fall vpon vs. For the one, we can no way remedie, becauſe we cannot reſiſt againſt the heauens: but the other, wee imagine, we might by ſome deuiſe haue preuented, if in due time, we would with diſcretion haue looked vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>All the Court, as well the higheſt as loweſt, endeuored what they could to comfort him, but he eſteemed that as a double griefe, to be perſwaded to be comforted by anie, hauing loſt her which was his chiefeſt comfort. In the ende he deuiſed theſe dolefull Ditties, in which kinde of exerciſe, hee ſpent moſt part of his weariſome time.</p>
               <p>This then, was the wofull Song, which he vſed oftentimes to ſigh forth, when hee was in his Chamber all alone, or walking amidſt the vncouth Forreſts, or when he was retired vnto ſome priuate place, along the ſolitary Sea-ſhore.</p>

               <p>Thus wailed this ſadde Prince continually, and to ſay truth, iuſt were his waylings, and but rightfull his complaints, conſidering how great his loyaltie was; and yet if he loued <hi>Iuſtina</hi> well, our Loue-ſick Caualier, honored her as much, if not more: for as he liked her for her beautie, ſo did he as much admire her for her vertue.</p>
               <p>To ſeeke to obtaine her, in hope to carrie away that which many a Louer propoſeth as a guerdon for his trauaile and paine which he hath taken: hee knewe full well that it was in vaine, and againſt his word and promiſe: and to eſpouſe and marrie her, being altogether ignorant of her byrth and eſtate, euery one knowing in what wretched ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he found her vpon the Sea-ſhore, all alone, hee durſt not, both for feare leſt hee ſhould doe iniurie vnto his houſe, from whence he deſcended, and alſo, leſt he ſhould prouoke the iuſt diſpleaſure of his beſt friendes and nigheſt kindred, in attempting ſo raſh an enterpriſe without their conſent.</p>
               <p>Thus was he troubled with many doubtes, ſtill running in his head, not knowing what way to take, or which courſe to reſolue vpon: No more then the Pilgrime, who being vnskilfull in his iourney,<note place="margin">A compariſon.</note> and comming to a foure croſſe-path-way, knoweth not which of them all rightly to chuſe.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, Loue got the aduantage of him daily, yea, and in that ſort, as in the end, he became abſolute maiſter of the Fort, and chiefe Lord and Conqueror, ouer the ſoule of the poore Gentleman. In ſo much as hee could no longer now conceale this hidden fire any more.</p>
               <p>The burning coale, couered with hot cinders, is more freſh, ardent, and full of heate, then the fiery flame it ſelfe. Very willing and faine was he, to haue bewrayed his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but he knewe not to whom, he being not ignorant, that none could eaſe him of his paine, but onely ſhee, who was the cauſe thereof, of whom he looked to reape but ſmall, or no comfort at all.</p>
               <p>The day and night was all one with him, for hee ſlept no more when the Moone gaue light, then when the Sunne ſhined: his greateſt contentment being, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the companie of his deere Miſtris, not remembring how the more he reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto her, the more his heart was inthralled, and caught in the nettes of Loues plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſeruitude and bondage.</p>
               <p>The often and dutifull deuoires hee alwayes vſed to doe her ſeruice, his ſtealing glaunces, and pittifull lookes he caſt vpon her beautious countenance, and his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all burning ſighes, comming like ſmoakie exhalations from his breſt, were the onely ſecret meſſengers of his minde vnto her.</p>
               <p>All which, the Ladie well perceiued, (although ſhee wiſely diſſembled the ſame) beginning as it were, now to participate with him, in the ſelfe-ſame paine, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a manner, the ſelfe-ſame that he did.</p>
               <p>But the feare ſhee had, leſt this good will ſhould force him to forget his promiſe, and his honorable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet is it lawfull for an honeſt woman to loue, for nothing is more ſacred in the whole world,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> then Loue: but yet ſo muſt they like, as they muſt ſeeeke to conſerue their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours chaſte and vntainted: ſuch was the loue that faire <hi>Iustina</hi> caſt vpon this Noble Spanyard.</p>
               <p>But as a ſubtill Tyrant, hauing ſet foote into ſome place, although at the firſt entrance (becauſe hee hath not as yet planted ſtrongly enough ſufficient forces, to ſerue his purpoſe) carryeth a ſhewe of mercie and mildneſſe to euery one where hee commeth, by which meanes (at the length) hee getteth to be abſolute Lorde and maiſter ouer the ſame: which authoritie afterwardes, hee exerciſeth with all kinde of cruelties, iniuſtice, and all other horrible faults that may be.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15406:38"/>Euen ſo Loue, hauing gained one of the gates of the heart of the Princeſſe, in the ende, made himſelfe chiefe ruler ouer all the Fortreſſe of her faire bodie.</p>
               <p>She now began to take liking vnto the ſweet lookes of the Gentlemen, to praiſe and make account of his ſeruices, and to lend a liſtning eare vnto his pleaſing ſpeeches: and as a ſicke perſon, leauing his bedde and chamber, doth giue teſtimonie vnto euery one, of his welfare and recouerie, by reaſon he findeth his ſtomack againe, and can diſgeſt his meare well: euen ſo, the delight and contentment, which ſhe tooke in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and in the behauiour of the Knight, was a ſufficient and aſſured ſigne of the great good will, and ſingular affection which ſhe bare him: yet was her fancie nothing like vnto that which <hi>(Alfonſo)</hi> for ſo was the Spaniards name, bare vnto her: it being of ſuch ſtrange force, as it not onely gouerned ouer his health and welfare, but alſo it helde in ſubiection his very ſoule, which moſt miſerablie languiſhed: Not vnlike vnto ſuch, who hauing taken a determinatiue kinde of poyſon, conſume away by little and little.</p>
               <p>Hee now thought, that there could be no ſuch rare contentment in this world, as to enioy the companie of his Goddeſſe, which could not be too deerely bought, although it ſhould coſt him his deereſt heart blood. Neither was he of the rainde he had bene before, to make a doubt what ſhe was, or that ſhe was of a more baſe or inferiour houſe then himſelfe was of.</p>
               <p>Loue now had drowned all ſuch doubtes in him, hee onely ſtudyed how he might worke the meanes to be gracious in her ſight, and to enioy her as his lawfull Bed-fellow and wife; knowing too too well, that her vertues would oppoſe themſelues againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſiniſter and diſhoneſt meanes, that ſhould be attempted againſt her: but this could he not doe, except he tooke a newe courſe, neither euer come to be maiſter of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, without opening his minde vnto her, in ſuch ſort, as he reſolued to giue his Miſtris to vnderſtand of the whole matter at large.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, as he was one day walking alone with her, after thouſands of ſighes ſent forth from his heart, with thouſands of pitious loue-lookes, moſt ſweetely glaunced on her, and with millions of ſweet alterations in his minde, his tongue trembling, and his voice fainting, his countenance and his colour altering and changing, and a cold Feuer running through all his bones, doubting leaſt he ſhould be repulſed with a ſharp deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, with a lowe and faint voyce, he began thus to accoſt her.</p>
               <p>Sweet <hi>Charge,</hi> for (ſo ſhe requeſted him to call her) the aſſured report of certaine things, amazeth oftentimes the ſpirit of man very much, but the experience of the ſame, giueth ſufficient teſtimonie, that it is moſt true.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake this vnto this end, for that I haue heard manieto diſcourſe often of Loue, who haue reported infinite ſtrange effects, which hee hath with great wonder brought to paſſe: ſo that I, for mine owne part, haue not a little admired him, in mine inward ſoule, yet could I neuer iudge rightly thereof, vntill experience had acquainted me with an infallible proofe, as concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Since which time, I (haue found afterward) that he is more wonderfull, then I haue bene giuen to vnderſtand, there being ſuch a certaine thing in Loue that none are able to expreſſe, hauing more diuinitie in him, then one can imagine, with which, only ſuch as are ſtrooken with his dart are acquainted withall, and none elſe.</p>
               <p>And certainly, hee may be well called <hi>DORDE,</hi> and liberall diſpoſer of mortall mens fortunes, ſeeing he is able to make ſuch as are Conquerours to yeelde, and force maiſters to become ſlaues vnto their owne ſeruants and vaſſailes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he ought by great reaſon to be termed a God, eſpecially amongſt ſuch as are moſt wretched and miſerable, who being ready, (as it were) to fall into the pitte, are by him holpen out, and lifted vp, giuing them commaund and power ouer their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>
               <p>This which I ſpeake is not by roate, nor by heare-ſay, but onely by good proofe, as I my ſelfe can beſt iuſtifie. For I finde my ſelfe vanquiſht by you, (faire Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman) whome enuious Fortune had ſometime (though moſt vniuſtly) brought into a moſt pittifull eſtate.</p>
               <p>Then am I your ſlaue, and yet none of theſe which ſeeke the diſhonour of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15406:39"/>to ſatisfie their ſenſuall deſires. But ſuch a one I am, as beareth more affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honor, then loue vnto your beautie.</p>
               <p>Needes muſt I confeſſe, I loue both the one and the other, endeuouring in what I may, for to conſerue them both, wiſhing to die a thouſand times, rather then ſuffer the leaſt wrong or iniurie to be offered vnto them. For your vertue doe I loue you; and for your beautie doe I honor you: for your modeſtie do I ſeeke you: and reuerence you, for your chaſtitie. If I were found to affect you, but for one of theſe good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities onely in you, may be, it were ſubiect, and likely to fall to ruine and decay: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo many goodly and ſacred foundations, and all vnited one vnto another, making it to be of an inuincible ſtrength; Me-thinks it is impoſſible, that euer this my loue ſhould be ſhaken or remoued from his firſt place.</p>
               <p>The hope of your goods, of your Nobleneſſe of byrth, or your riches, are not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of the good liking I haue of you, in that I am not acquainted with any ſuch matters, but onely with your Nobleneſſe: I rather hating ſuch friendſhips, becauſe they are loſt and ended, as ſoone as poſſeſſion is taken of ſuch things, vpon which they were founded. I then loue you, with a ſacred and chaſte kind of loue, beſeeching you, that I may be recompenced with the like affection againe.</p>
               <p>For no woman can any way offer iniurie vnto her reputation and credit, to loue thoſe, that ſeeke to conſerue the ſame: neither ſhall that loue which is loyall, be euer defrauded of his due, becauſe it hath alwayes a greater reſpect vnto the conſeruation of that thing which the woman loueth chiefly, then to the pleaſure hee taketh in the fruition and enioying of her beautie.</p>
               <p>But if my ſpotleſſe amitie be of any merit or worth with you, I then moſt humblie intreate you, ſo much to fauor me, as to make me acquainted with your eſtate, the cauſe of this your misfortune, your parentage, and houſe you come of, and what your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conceit is of me, to the end I may either liue in aſſurance of ſome ſweete hope, or euer after paſſe my time in moſt wretched and remedileſſe diſpaire?</p>
               <p>The Princeſſe who (already in her conſcience) acknowledged her ſelfe much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the Knight, and who thought him to deſerue the better, in that he loued her with ſo great conſideration and reſpect, ſhe being ſicke of the ſame maladie that he was diſeaſed, and finding the deſires of her mind, (to cope and iump with thoſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans) they agreeing both in one alike, with a lowe, yet a ſweet ſpeech, returned him this gratious anſwere.</p>
               <p>Noble Gouernor, if I had no other aſſurance of your excellent vertues, then your faith, which you haue moſt ſtrictly kept, and the reſpectiue care you haue alwayes had moſt reuerently of mine Honor, I cannot thinke, your intention and meaning, to be otherwiſe, then moſt chaſte, honeſt, and laudable euery way: For ſhould you haue any other worſe pretence towards mee, I cannot ſee what profite might redound vnto you thereby. I confeſſe you may (if you pleaſe) I being now in your power, force my chaſt will, but yet, this pleaſure ſhould be both diſhonorable, in that you haue falſified your faith, and offered violence vnto a ſillie mayden, who hath nought but teares to defend her, and alſo ſhort &amp; bootleſſe, becauſe this hand ſhould purge and waſh cleane my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of this fault, with the loſſe of his beſt blood, which I would offer vnto mine Honor, to appeaſe his wrath and anger. As for this ſacred amitie which you aſſure me of, I hold it moſt deere and agreeable, becauſe it being ſuch as you tell me, I know it will alwayes loue that which I tccount of moſt chiefly, which is my reputation and credit, ſtudying, by all poſſible means to conſerue the ſame, to the end it may ſtill preſerue me aliue.</p>
               <p>And this is is a true ſigne, and an infallible teſtimony of faithful and loyall Louers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: For if they loue their Ladies entirely, then will they neuer offer violence, nor ſeeke to wrong that thing which they account of moſt, which they eſteeme of, as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as their liues, &amp; of which they make reckoning of, as of their only glory &amp; renowm For as we cannot rightly call that friendſhip true loue, which a thiefe maketh a ſhew of, to heare vnto an honeſt man, becauſe it is a colour only to robbe him of his goods and wealth:<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> euen ſo, that loue is no loue, but rather a moſt diſloyall furie, which a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth vnto a woman, when through the onely ſhadow of the ſame, he ſeeketh to take from her, her ſole and onely treaſure, which is, her high priced Honor.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:15406:39"/>
               <p>For what law can bind a man to thinke well of ſuch a Fellon as hath ſtolen from him all the riches he hath, vnder a counterfaite ſhew that he loued him? And what Subiect can a woman haue, to make account of the loue of ſuch a man, who vnder this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite maske, hath reft her of her credit, glorie and reputation.</p>
               <p>I can neuer thinke, that euer there can be any orderly forme of proceedings of loue amongſt ſuch perſons, and that woman, that doth not repute him for her mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that would with violence, ſeaze vpon her chaſtitie, is the onely murtherer of her owne ſelfe, yea farre worſe then he, that killeth his owne parents. For what lawe can binde a man to credit, to affect, and to entertaine friendly, him, that openly ſeeketh to take away his life forcibly from him? So likewiſe, who can compell a woman, to loue and hold him in eſteeme, that ſeeketh by all meanes he can, the ouerthrow of her honour?</p>
               <p>More reaſon is it, that the robber by the high way ſide ſhould die, then the true man, that ſtandeth vpon his owne defence: And ſo is it more neceſſarie, that the woman ſhould rather ſuffer the enemie of her chaſtitie to periſh, then to conſerue him aliue, to the vtter ruine and deſtruction of the ſame: in as much as the death of one man, is but a loſſe vnto one alone, where the ſhipwracke of a woman, is not onely hurtfull vnto her ſelfe, but alſo vnto her whole kindred.</p>
               <p>As for mine owne part, I will neuer thinke, that that man loueth me, (what ſhew ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he carrieth,) what cunning deuiſes ſoeuer he vſeth, and what ſignes of griefe ſoeuer appeareth, who hath an intention to diſpoyle my chaſtitie, louing more his ſenſuall pleaſure, then my good name or fame: but rather accounting him for my deadlieſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, will I enforce my ſelfe alwaies to reuenge me of his villanous minde towards me, arming in what I can, both heauen and earth, againſt him.</p>
               <p>I neither meane, nor ſeeke this of you, being alreadie throughly perſwaded of the innocencie of your ſoule, and of your chaſte, and right honeſt good will towards me, which maketh me the bolder to bewray my eſtate and condition vnto you, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing any thing that is of importance from you.</p>
               <p>Know then (moſt courteous Knight) I am the vnfortunate daughter of <hi>Arnolde,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauiere,</hi> betrothed by him (but yet without my conſent euery way) vnto the King of <hi>Denmarkes</hi> Sonne, who ſending a companie of ſhips for me, as we were ſailing vpon the Seas, ſodenly a ſtorme hapned, which for a long time raged ſo cruellie, as in the end, all our fleete was caſt away, and I by fortune throwne vpon your ſhore, in ſuch eſtate as you found me, whome neuertheleſſe I cannot much accuſe, in that ſhe hath brought me to be vnder your protection, you being for your fidelitie, honeſtie, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and continencie, which I finde in your vertuous and liberall Spirit, not a little to be commended.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I diſcouered mine eſtate vnto you, according vnto your deſire, &amp; I coniure you, by all the Gods, that in requitall of the ſame, you will alwaies remember your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and ſeeke to preſerue that which you cannot bereaue me of, without loſſe of my deareſt life.</p>
               <p>All thoſe, not a little amazed at the ſolemne diſcourſe of the Princes, admiring more and more her beautie, her houſe, and Princely deſcent, kneeling downe before her, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie craued pardon for the neglect of honour, which was due vnto her, excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in that he was ignorant of her qualitie, and promiſing (hereafter) to amend the ſame (and to haue reſpect vnto her) according vnto her Royall degree.</p>
               <p>But ſhe, that deſired not to be knowne (for feare leaſt being diſcourered, ſhe ſhould be conueied vnto the Prince of <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſo by that meanes forced to leaue the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight, whome now ſhe dearely loued (although ſhe ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the ſame) moſt earneſtly deſired him, not to bewray what ſhe was vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, vntill ſhe ſhould finde a fit time to be knowne. Which he moſt willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, giuing her more honour from that time forward, and vſing her with greater reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, then he had done before: verie much diſcondemning his owne iudgement, in that he could not perceiue this Ladie to be noblie diſcended, ſeeing ſo many rich proofes, and apparant ſignes of the ſame, as her courtly demeanure, her rare vertue, her ſtately Maieſtie, her learned diſcourſe, and excellent beautie gaue forth ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15406:40"/>which euery one did admire at.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Meane time, theſe vertuous Louers twaine, did burne in oneſelfe fire,</l>
                  <l>And languiſhing, did pine away, for want of their deſire.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But alas, no remedie could be found to eaſe their paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; for the gentleman knowing the Princes deſcent to be ſo great and worthie, durſt not as much as once preſume to thinke, ſhe would vouchſafe to accept him for her husband, chuſing rather to die a thouſand times, then to be very troubleſome vnto her, or to receiue ſo bitter a pill from her, as a ſharpe repulſe, which he knew he ſhould neuer be able to diſieſt, but onely by death. This conceit bred ſuch a melancolie apprehenſion in him, as by little and little, he began to languiſh away, his blood was dried vp, his colour gone, and his ſtrength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, ſo as he ſeemed rather a dead coarſe, readie to be laid in his graue, then a man like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to liue.</p>
               <p>This ſudden accident troubled euery one, all lamenting the misfortune of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knight, eſpeciallie wofull <hi>Iuſtina,</hi> who knew her ſelfe to be the onely cauſe of this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and which was worſe, knew no meanes how to remedie the ſame, without diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto her credit; yet in the ende, ſhe reſolued with her ſelfe, if otherwiſe then well ſhould happen vnto <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> to die for his ſake, ſo dearely did ſhe loue him; who now was growne, to be in ſuch a pittifull taking, as he could neither reſt, ſleepe, eate nor drinke, ſo as he was forced (although ſore againſt his will) to keepe his loathed bed, where he thought neuer to haue ſeene his Miſtris more.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange thing, Louers reſemble the Baſiliske, who deſireth to ſee that within a criſtall glaſſe, which is the cauſe of his owne death. So theſe poore wretches, couet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as the preſence of that thing, which doth ſhorten their liues ſooneſt, thinking themſelues moſt miſerable, when they are depriued of the ſame. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no time happie, but when they feele death, and nothing is more agreeable vnto them, then that Subiect, which taketh away their life from them. Verilie, if the law doth moſt iuſtly condemne ſuch for wilfull murtherers, as deſtroy and make away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, then ought Louers, to be placed amongſt the ranke of theſe her ſelfe-wild mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, for their onely follie, haſtneth the ende of their liues, making them to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time.</p>
               <p>This poore knight lieth grieuouſly ſicke, without hope of recouerie, and <hi>Iustina</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth (for companie) to take the like courſe, ſhe thinking it to be no reaſon that ſhe ſhould liue ioyfully, when her friend ſhould be dead, through her onely occaſion. O how bitterly did ſhe curſe her cruell fortune, ſeeing her ſelfe inuironed with two ſuch violent extremities, either to permit him to die, whom ſhe loued more then her ſelfe, or elſe to ſuffer her honour to be crazed, which ſhe loathed more then death.</p>
               <p>In the ende ſhe reſolued rather to ende her daies, then to ſcandaliſe her good fame with ſoule reproach, and to leaue the bodies both of her ſelfe, and her friend breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, then to deface her chaſtitie, which ſhe preferred before all things elſe in the world. Hauing ſet vp her reſt thus, ſhe goeth to viſit her ſickly friend, who ſeeing her come, began to open his eyes, to mooue his bodie, and to change his colour and countenance: which ſoden alteration, ſhe preſently perceiued, by reaſon ſhe knew better then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe of his ſicknes, comming to his bed ſide, ſhe ſits her downe by him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the hand, with a ſoft and pittious voice, ſhe began thus to ſpeake vnto him.</p>
               <p>What cheare ſweet Gouernor, and how fare you? what will you with this your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, make ſo many of your good friends ill, who ſo much loue you, and deſire your welfare?

               <p>Claſping her faire &amp; white hand, hard within his, forcing the very walles themſelues to yearne and grieue, at his pittious languiſhing, with a hollow voice, interrupted with many ſobs and ſighes, perceiuing death to approach, he faintly replied thus.</p>
               <p>Ah my ſweet Charge, what fault haue I committed, that you ſhould enuie at this ſmall reſt, which I finde whilſt I am dying? and why doe you malice my fortune, when by death I hope to rid my ſelfe from theſe ſo helliſh torments? Let me I pray you, depart hence quietly, who deſerue not to liue, ſince whilſt I liued, I could not conquere my ſelfe. If the braue Caualiere, ſuffereth himſelfe ſometimes to die, for very griefe to ſee himſelfe ouercome, and if right generous mindes, thinke ſcorne to beg life of the victor, chuſing rather to die, then to liue and carie the marke of a vanquiſht perſon in their face; how much more iuſtly then ought he to conſent to his owne death, and die willingly, who ouer-charged with ordinarie fooliſh paſſions, hath not bene able to conquere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</p>
               <p>It is not for me (Madame) to liue any longer, ſeeing I am not of power to hinder and forbid, louing that, which is the occaſion of my death becauſe I finde my ſelfe, vnworthie to enioy the ſame.

               <p>Iudge then (moſt gratious Ladie) and iudge but rightly, how ſacred and chaſt, how faithfull and firme my loue hath alwaies bene, which forceth me rather to die moſt wretchedly, then to diſcouer it vnto you, for feare of offending your more then wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertue. But alas, I, not onely ſacrifice this my life vnto your diuine deitie, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more would I offer, if I had ſo many, onely to be reconciled vnto you.

So I, ſeeing my ſelfe voyd of all health and helps, to what ende ſhould I longer prolong my dolorous life, to lengthen my cares the more? And yet, if it were poſſible you might be moued with a ſolemne proteſtation, of a iuſt, loyall, and liuely affection borne towards you; or if the misfortune of him (who for feare to offend you, moſt willingly abandoneth his life) might touch you with ſome ſmall drop of pittie; Ah then (Miſtris) ſuffer I beſeech you, this wretched carkaſſe of mine, to be enterred in your preſence, to the ende, that euen vnto his Tombe, he may

               <p>Therefore was it fitteſt for him to die, ſeeing whilſt he liued, he was found as <hi>(Non proficiens)</hi> in the ſeruice of her, vnto whome he was endebted for his life. The onely thing I wiſh for in this world, was but once more to ſee you, to the ende I might certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie you of my minde, as (now) I haue done: and to ſatisfie my weeping eyes, who would haue died moſt vnwillingly, if they had not once beheld your ſweet ſelfe, before the cloſing vp of their lids: which requeſt, ſince I haue obtained, to what purpoſe ſhould I longer breathe?</p>

So I, now the houre-glaſſe of my life is run out, now I haue ſeene, ſpoken, and obtained what I requeſted ſo much, why ſhould not I repoſe my ſelfe as well as others, and quietly goe downe into my graue in peace? I muſt ſweet Ladie, I needs muſt die, and bid you hartily farewell. I muſt die, for griefe to want your preſence, and looſe your companie. But for a mortall diſeaſe, no remedie is to be found. Pardon me, if I ſpeake more boldly then becommeth me, and thinke, that he that lieth on his death bed, hath libertie at that time to deliuer his minde at full.</p>
               <p>Aboue all, I here proteſt vnto you, and moſt humblie, (by the name of God, by your faire vertues, by your Princely deſcent, by your ſacred honour, &amp; by your rare beautie,) I earneſtly entreate you to beleeue me, that I neuer deſired any thing more, then the conſeruation of your chaſtitie: &amp; that I neuer ſo much wiſhed mine owne good, as I haue alwaies ſought to maintaine your renowme and glorie. Yet before I die, let me intreat you ſweet Miſtris, to heare a few verſes, which the remembrance of you, and death to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, endited in memoriall of your chaſt amitie: for he dieth not at all, who dying, ſeeth himſelfe Imprinted in the mindes of his beſt friends, moſt ſorrowfull for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. And hauing ſo ſaid, he called his ſad Page vnto him, who, being commanded by him, tooke his Lute in his hand, and with an excellent ſweet voyce, vnto a moſt dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tune, ſung theſe verſes following, before his weeping Miſtris.</p>

               <p>The Page hauing ſung this wofull Dittie, vnto a paſſing mournfull note, wrought ſo much by his excellent cunning, as the ſoule of the Princeſſe was rauiſhed with the ſame, ſo that not being able any longer to withhold her ſelfe from weeping, ſhee left her ſicke Patient, in whoſe eares (as ſhe was taking her leaue) ſhe ſoftly whiſpered theſe fewe, but yet ſweete ſpeeches. Courage true Seruant, and liue in hope, expecting from me all the helps that may be, to recouer your grieuous ſicknes, which ſhall be ſuch, yea, and that in ſuch an ample manner, as I will endaunger mine owne life, to reſtore you to yours, and will not ſticke to looſe my ſelfe, ſo I may ſaue you.</p>
               <p>Saying ſo, ſhe went her wayes, leauing <hi>Alfonſo</hi> to muſe on this matter, canauſſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers conceits in his braine. By reaſon of theſe laſt words which ſhe vttered, he knewe not well how to take them, nor how to vnderſtand them, nor ſcarcely what to make of them. Yet in the meane time, he ſtayed to ſee what effects would follow vpon the ſame, and looked for ſome good Fortune to happen: Not vnlike vnto the criminall, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth ſome fauour or friendſhip promiſed him by the Iudge. And now he beginneth ſome what to comfort himſelfe, for that hee perceiued ſome pittie in the remorſefull eyes of his relenting Ladie, who being tormented with diuers paſſions, knewe not well what to ſay, what to doe, or what to reſolue vpon. The death of her Friend went neere her, his loyall and ſincere affection pleaded for ſome commiſſeration vnto her: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the exceeding great paines &amp; trauell he had taken in her behalfe, &amp; the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable curteſies, &amp; infinite kindneſſes ſhe had receiued at his hands, began to make a breach into her conſtant breſt: ſo as at the laſt, doe what ſhe could, ſhe yeelded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wholly his. On the other ſide, the feare and doubt, leſt ſhe ſhould doe any thing which might be a ſcandall vnto her Honor, or a blemiſh vnto her inuincible chaſtitie, which ſhe had ſo long, and with ſo great admiration kept inuiolable &amp; vntainted, made her giue ouer, and retire from her firſt determination.<note place="margin">A Similin.</note> As wee ſee a floating veſſell in the troubled Sea, toſſed and tumbled with two contrarie windes, neither forward, nor backward, nor to paſſe one way, nor another; Euen ſo fared the mind of this delicate Virgin, who being ouercharged with many conceits and opinions, knew not on which to reſolue. Yet in the ende, <hi>Loue</hi> got the vpper hand: For as a flame of fire, feazing vpon a drye peece of wood, couered with greene Iuie, glideth ouerth wart the ſame, and at the laſt, burueth into aſhes, both the wood and the greene leaues together.

And now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prouided euery thing fit for his iourney, kiſſing his faire wife, he taketh his leaue, whilſt with teares in his eyes, he promiſed to returne as ſpeedily as might be.</p>
               <p>But alack,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> it is great folly for a man to giue his word or promiſe to perform any thing, ſeeing he is a ſeruant vnto the will of the Heauens, who may diſpoſe of him as they beſt pleaſe.

               <p>But now <hi>Alfonſo</hi> being come vnto the Court, his friendes entertained him with all Courtly compliments that might be, as his vertues well deſerued the ſame, each No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man ſaluteth him moſt kindely, thinking the Court not to be a little honored with the preſence of ſo braue and valorous a Caualier.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he thus ſtayed, attending the pleaſure of his King, Beholde there arriueth an Embaſſador from the Prince of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> certifying the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that his Lords wife was held as priſoner, in a certaine part of his Realme, deſiring his Maieſtie, to command her to be rendered vnto him: otherwiſe, not to thinke ill of him, if hee ſhould doe his beſt endeuour for to recouer her againe, by force of Armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alfonſo</hi> being preſent at this Embaſſage, (for it was all the Countrey ouer, how hee came by his wife) and therefore it was verily ſuppoſed, that ſhee was the ſame woman which the Prince demaunded, (preſently replyed, ſaying) that true it was; that not long ſince he found a Ladie halfe dead, which the waues of the Seas (after ſhee had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſhipwrack) had driuen vpon the ſhore, where hee inhabited, and that afterward he married her with her owne conſent and free will, ſhe hauing before aſſured him, yea, and which is more, taking her oath vpon the holy <hi>Euangelists,</hi> that ſhe neuer betrothed, nor promiſed herſelfe vnto any other man liuing but himſelfe: Affirming, that as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentlewoman, was his true and lawfull Spouſe, ſo he was reſolued to defend and keepe her, againſt all ſuch as ſhould goe about to take her from him by force: Vowing to be their death, and vtter ouerthrow, as moſt wicked enemies vnto the maieſtie of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred wedlocke.</p>
               <p>The King hearing <hi>Alfonſoes</hi> anſwer, and iudging his reaſons to be both iuſt and tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, returned back the Embaſſador, with the foreſaid ſpeeches, who deliuered them vnto his Prince, aſſoone as he came home.</p>

Which was the cauſe that this youthfull Lord, went about moſt raſhly and vnaduiſedly to ſet vpon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, to begin moſt fooliſhly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime warre againſt him, who quickly would haue ouerrunne all his countrie, had not the Nobilitie of <hi>Denmarke</hi> croſſed the ſame: For they very wiſely, iudging that they were not able to incounter well ſo great an enemie, and that their ſlender ſhoulders, were too weake to ſupport ſo great a burthen, would by no meanes yeeld vnto his collericke and haſtie motion, who although he ſaw himſelfe to be forſaken of his owne ſubiects, yet for all that, would he not giue ouer his firſt enterpriſe: determining with himſelfe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his Miſtris againe, or elſe to looſe his life. Wherupon he ſent another Embaſſador vnto the King, to demaund licenſe of him (according vnto the auncient law of Armes) that he might combat with him, who detained his ſpouſe ſo wrongfully from him, to the ende the fortune of warre might determine and ſet downe which of them twaine ſhould enioy her.</p>
               <p>The King hearing this motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, entreated <hi>Alfonſo</hi> to condiſcend therevnto: who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that with his credit he could not refuſe it, as willingly accepted thereof, as the other earneſtly did challenge him: which the rather he did, becauſe he might hereafter qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly enioy his deare wife, without any more quarrells. The <hi>Denmarke</hi> Prince, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that the combat was graunted, determined with himſelfe, to trie the vtmoſt of his fortune, although much againſt the mindes of all his Barrons, and Noblemen. But who can ſhut vp and incloſe vertue, force the waues of the Sea to ſtand ſtill,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> or bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ſtately courſe of the Sunne?

               <p>Thus the Prince poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of loue, taketh in hand the comb at againſt the aduiſe of all his Nobles, and hauing prouided euery thing fit for that purpoſe, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth at the Court of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, with a gallant troupe attending on him, where he was receiued according vnto his greatnes, and as his worthines well deſerued. Great was the deſire that euery one had, to ſee this Princely Dane, who was famous for his chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he being come ſo farre to trie the combat with his enemie, to reuenge him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, which (as he ſuppoſed) was done vnto him. Hauing a day of hearing appoynted him by the King, he forthwith craued audience, declaring openly vnto him, the cauſe of his comming, reaccounting the equitie of his cauſe, pleading hardly for his right, and in concluſion, demaunded to haue Iuſtice. On the other ſide, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> diſcourſing at large in his owne defence, ſheweth plainly, what intereſt he hath in the Ladie, proteſting (by the permiſſion of his Soueraigne) to maintaine this quarrell againſt all men liuing, with the perill of his life.</p>
               <p>At the laſt (theſe two Caualiers) not agreeing) the combat is graunted vnto them, but yet with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that the Ladie ſhall be the prize of the Conquerour: and that the conquered, ſhall neuer after make claime vnto her. The day is appoynted, the field cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, their armour prouided, and Iudges ſubſtituted onely for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The King hauing cauſed many ſcaffolds to be erected, as well for himſelfe, as for his owne Nobles, &amp; diuers other honourable ſtrangers, great was the concourſe of people that were gathered together, to ſee the euent and iſſue of this daungerous battell.

                  <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had bene vanquiſht, but a great fire of ſtrawe, is quickly extinguiſhed. In like manner, the blowes that deſpite and rage giueth, are aſſoone ended. Meane-while, our Spaniard fought coldly, but yet with great aduiſement, neuer ſtriking, but to the purpoſe, &amp; ſo ſtill kept himſelfe in breath with great aduantage. The Prince redoubling his ſtrokes, ſuppoſing his foe was growen feeble, both in force &amp; courage, laid on loade, hurting him vpon the left arme. This wound, from which the blood iſſued apace, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her who was the cauſe of this warre, the preſence of the King, and the flower of Chiualrie of all his countrie, did ſtirre vp the Spaniard ſo much, as now he would combat no more ſoberly and with diſcretion, but as a deſperate Souldiour againſt his deadly enemie, letting driue at him ſo luſtily, with ſuch quicknes, and ſuch dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the <hi>Dane</hi> found he was not a little deceiued in him.</p>
               <p>But as he was chaſing of him thus, by chaunce <hi>Alphonſoes</hi> ſword fell out of his hand, he hauing nothing now but his dagger to defend himſelfe withall, which was the reaſon euery one thought as then, that he was but a dead man, his enemie promiſing vnto himſelfe the victorie, the deſire of which made him purſue the Spaniard hotly, who knew not which way to furniſh himſelfe of a Target, nor how to warrantiſe his honour, and his life, but onely by running in vpon the Dane, and ſo by maine force, to get him downe; which deuiſe of his, the other fearing, looked more warily vnto himſelfe, leſt he ſhould get within him, whilſt in the meane time, he gaue him many a ſore wound, which he could not well eſcape, becauſe he wanted his weapon. In the ende, ſuch was the good fortune of the Spaniard, that the Dane thinking to runne full but at him with all his force, (which the other auoyded by mouing his body from that place lightly) his ſword alſo ſlipt out of his hand, ſo as they were now weapond alike: when comming to handie gripes, and to grappell together, <hi>Alphonſo</hi> proued to be the ſtronger of the twaine, flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his enemie downe, and giuing him ſo terrible a knocke withall, as both ſpeech and ſenſes failed him.

               <p>But the Prince, chooſing rather death, than ſhame and vtter deſtruction, then the depriuation of his Miſtris, diſdained to anſwere him, looking ſtill when the other would ſtabbe him quite through: which neuertheleſſe (as a right Noble minde) he would not, but leauing the Dane wallowing in his owne blood, and ſore bruiſed with his fall, he commeth vnto the Iudges, demaunding of them, if he had done ſufficient to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the vanguiſher, and to haue obtained the glory of the victorie or no. Who much commending him for his clemencie, in that he had ſo cutreouſly pardoned his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, told him, he had performed his duetie euery way: that done, he was conducted vnto the place where the King ſat, who highly praiſed him for his valour, and greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him for his vertue, gaue him leaue to depart his Royall preſence. From thence he rode vnto the Court, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with thouſands of braue Knights, where with great

               <p>Not long after, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Prince was carried out of the field ſore wounded, and wel nigh dead for griefe and ſhame; curſing his bad fortune, that he had not bene kild out right: who although he was highly beholding vnto <hi>Alphonſo</hi> for his life, yet did he moſt tratierouſly conſpire in his minde to murther him one way or other, ſuffering himſelfe rather to be tranſported with baſe reuenge, then with ſage reaſon, or with honeſtie of the cauſe.</p>

               <p>Thriſe happie had ſhe bin, and not a little beholding vnto death, if (at that houre) he had bereft her of life: but her fortune was not ſo good, for ſhe was compelled to liue the longer, becauſe her paine ſhould be the greater. And now ſhe being come vnto her ſelfe againe, although it was a woful mirrour to behold his pale &amp; bloodleſſe face, &amp; his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled fleſh all to be ſprinkled &amp; waſhed in his owne gore; yet did ſhe not ſticke to kiſſe his wan and cold lips, a thouſand times and more, whilſt her teares ſerued her in ſteed of water to make cleane his wounds, to waſh away the blood, and to ſolemnize his drerie Funerall with the ſame.</p>
               <p>Careleſſe of her health, ſhe lay long time vpon the wet ground, whilſt ſhe held the coarſe as pittifully in her lap, as the kind nurſe doth her little Infant in her armes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſhe remoue her ſweet mouth from his, but kept it ſtill cloſe thereon, deſirous to die as he had done. Out alas, alas (cried ſhe) where am I? who am I? &amp; what do I ſee? is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I ſhould yet breath, hauing loſt the onely life of my ſoule? And you mine eyes, are you ſo cruell vnto my health, that you will abide to behold that which will force you to be more miſerable? and yet mine eyes, my wofull eyes, it is no ſhame to behold your beſt benefactor: looke then, on him your fill, although pittileſſe death hath cloſed vp his ſight with an eternall ſleepe. But thou art dead for me, (my deare husband) for my cauſe haſt thou loſt thy life, and for no other. O wretched iourney, and moſt vnhappie that euer thou tookeſt in hand: yet was it not death that ſlew thee. No, no, death durſt</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:15406:45"/>
               <p>But it was I, and euen I, t'was I, and none but I, and I alone, whome thou diddeſt thinke to be thy louing wife. Ah ſweete, ſweet Husband, ſhall I be guiltie of this fault, by murthering of my ſelfe, which I haue committed againſt thee?</p>
               <p>No, no, for my death cannot counteruaile thine. Shall it be ſaid, that I doe liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, and ſuruiue him who was the onely nouriſher of my dolorous life?</p>
               <p>Can I abide to be one minute of an houre from thee, who haſt ſo much alwayes deſired the companie of hapleſſe <hi>Iustina?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah mine eyes, mine eyes, as much as you ſhewed your ſelues cheerfull, to delight the heart of my Husband in your Loues: ſo much, or more, ſhew your ſelues full of ſalt teares, to lament his diſaſter.</p>
               <p>But teares are the common offerings of euery woman, at their husbands buryalls,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> and are too baſe oblations for ſo worthie and ſolemne an exequies. Thy friendſhip deſerueth better then ſo: And more am I obliged vnto thee, then to offer ſuch baſe trifles. Not my blubbering teares, but my heart blood is due vnto thee. For why ſhould it not be thine, when my verie ſoule is at thy ſeruice?</p>
               <p>Ah cruell <hi>Honor,</hi> why haſt thou not rendered mee againe mine <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> in the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame manner, as thou tookeſt him from mee to doe thee ſeruice? And how badly haſt thou requited the paines hee hath taken, in ſeeking to preſerue thee fafe and ſound? Who euer would haue thought I ſhould haue ſeene ſo horrible a ſight as I ſee, before I had dyed? and who would haue imagined, but that my praiers which I made continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie vnto God, to take me out of the world before my ſweet Husband, ſhould not haue obtained grace from <hi>Heauen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But come the worſt that can come, there ſhall not be much difference of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our deaths, for (ſo) quickly will we follow one another, that if one houre can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cut vs off both together, yet (at leaſt) one day ſhall diſpatch and make vs away. But in the meane ſpace, iuſtly maieſt thou complaine of me (my deare Knight) in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world: for that I haue bene the murtherer of thy life.</p>
               <p>But I beſeech thee, complaine not of that, neither of her, who thinketh the time but miſerable, in which ſhe liueth exiled and baniſhed from thee. Woe is mee, I haue killed, I haue ſlaine and murthered that which I loued moſt vpon the earth: And vnto him, which (I know and acknowledge) I was moſt beholding.</p>
               <p>But is this poſſible? Alack, alack, it is but too true. Blacke and vnluckie was our marriage, not vnlike vnto that of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Hellena:</hi> the concluſion whereof, was bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die woe, and ſorrowfull death. Ah my tongue, canſt thou yet talke? and thou my heart, canſt thou ſtill breathe? and yee mine eyes, are you not yet blinde? Alas, I liue not, for the leaſt anguiſh that I endure, is a greater hell then death vnto me.</p>
               <p>And thou partiall death, who art not ignorant that my Husband and I were but one onely perſon, why killing him, haſt thou not done the like vnto me? Or, if thou then hadſt forgotten the ſame, why doeſt not thou (now) better remember thy ſelfe? Come then (moſt welcome death) come I pray, and permit not her to liue, that ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to attend on thee.</p>
               <p>And yet before I depart, where ſhall I find eyes ſufficient to weepe, and lamentings, bitter enough, to be conformable vnto the ſorrowes of my ſoule?</p>
               <p>Oh that this my humor, changing it ſelfe wholly into teares, and drowning me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in it, might be ſo forth ate, to drowne therewith all my torments alſo. And alack, what intollerable pangs doe I ſuffer? can any ſauadge body endure the ſame, and yet not part hence? And can mine eyes view my Spouſe giue vp his ghoſt, and not ſeale vp their liddes, with an euerlaſting ſlumber?</p>
               <p>Louing and louely bedfellow, as heretofore our affections were loyall, true, and chaſt, ſo as loyall, ſweet, and chaſt, ſhall our entombings be together. Sweet Husband, as long as thou liuedſt, thou neuer wouldeſt depriue me of thy kinde and friendly embracings: Ah then, I deſire thee, let me not be defrauded of thy death. For I am not worthie to be called thy wife, if I doe not as well participate of thy bad fortunes, as of thy good, and take a ſay of thy ſowre, as well as I haue done of thy ſweet: If ioy could neuer diuide our foules, why ſhould they then be vntyed by death? And as I heeretofore haue ſlept with thee in the ſelfe-ſame bed (as our ſacred marriage appointed vs) ſo I beſeech thee,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15406:46"/>denie mee not to lye with thee, in the ſelfe-ſame Tombe that thou doeſt.</p>
               <p>Whliſt we were liuing, we were perfitly vnited together, being dead, wee will be as kindly ioyned one vnto another.</p>
               <p>As well ſhalt thou be my husband now thou art dead, as when thou wert aliue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Deſtinies themſelues hinder me from following thee ſtill, to aſſiſt and helpe thee, according vnto my bounden dutie.</p>
               <p>But now alas, before I come vnto thee, how ſhall I pay the laſt remainders of my Loue which I owe thee? By what teſtimony ſhall I render ſufficient proofe of mine ardent affection towards thee? and what perfect ſignes ſhall I ſhewe of my true dolour, as thou too too well deſerueſt?</p>
               <p>In times paſt,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> thoſe women that loued their husbands beſt, vſed to ſacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the fire, burning their bodies, becauſe they would die with them. And ſhall I be leſſe dutifull then thoſe? And what, cannot I? for my Loue is more perfect then theirs was.</p>
               <p>But yet before I die, let me kiſſe thoſe eyes, which (liuing) rauiſhed my libertie: thoſe eyes which were of late the cheerfull Sun of my ſoule: thoſe eyes which once nouriſhed my ſadde and dulled ſpirits. So let me touch thoſe ſugred lips, whoſe liuely breath was ſometimes the chiefe comfort of my minde, and a precious balme to my griefe: And thou faire countenance, wherein ſometimes lay all my hopes, whoſe louely preſence entertained my good Fortune; Neuer ſhall I be ſatisfied enough in kiſſing of thee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can my mortall deſires be ſatisfied as they wiſh.</p>
               <p>Ay me; was I borne to murther mine owne life? and was I ſo vnluckie in my birth, that I could not dye, without the loſſe of that which I helde as deare as mine inward ſoule?</p>
               <p>And thou my ſoule, how hard is thy trouble? how heauie thy languiſhing? and how wretched thy eſtate, whilſt that of mine Eſpouſe liueth glorious by me heerein? I can no longer talke, and too long haue I prolonged my life, and it may ſeeme my griefe is the leſſe, in that I haue had ſuch libertie of ſpeech. But how?</p>
               <p>The Swan ſingeth ſweetly at the houre of her death,<note place="margin">An example.</note> then let none wonder though I waile and lament ſo much, mine ende being ſo nigh. Diſpatch then, miſerable <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and performe the laſt vowes, which are due vnto thy <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> to the ende thou maiſt haſten the more to follow him.</p>
               <p>And therewithall ſhe ſo often kiſſed and rekiſſed him, as his Ghoſt for a while once returned againe into his bodie, whilſt hauing heard what pitious mone ſhee made for him, he ſtriueth euen in the middeſt of his death pangs, to open his cloſed eyes, and pale mouth, a little to looke (once more) vpon her, and to vtter theſe fewe words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.</p>
               <p>Ah my deare ſoule, and deerer then my ſoule, if it were poſſible. Why afflicting thy ſelfe thus, doeſt thou adde more miſerie vnto my paine? If euer I haue merited anie thing at thy handes, then I coniure thee, by that moſt faithfull amitie I haue borne thee whileſt I liued, forbeare to lament or grieue any more.</p>
               <p>And ſuffer I pray poore <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to die quietly, who accounteth himſelfe moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, in that he ſeeth, he dieth in thy good grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>Moſt fortunare doeth he die, hauing bene brought to his ende by baſe treaſon, and not through braue valour, hauing before reuenged himſelfe of thy mortall enemie, my deere and louely Ladie.</p>
               <p>Now if I ſhall finde that thou ſeemeſt to enuie at my glorie, ſhall I not then haue reaſon to complaine of thee? to accuſe thy friendſhip, to thinke hardlie of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and laſtly, to condemne thy moſt loyall Loue?</p>
               <p>Alas <hi>Iustina,</hi> wilt thou make mee ſo miſerable, as I ſhall heare my ſelfe to be the cauſe of thy death, now I am dying? Ah doe not that iniurie or wrong vnto him, who hath loued thee dearer then the apples of his owne eyes.</p>
               <p>How deerely, and at what a high price doeſt thou ſell to mee this laſt pleaſure which I finde in dying before thy preſence?</p>
               <p>Diddeſt thou thinke <hi>Iustina,</hi> when thou marriedſt mee, that thou hadſt wedded ſome God or other, that was immortall?</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:15406:46"/>
               <p>(Deare heart) Death is common and naturall to all men, without ſparing of any:<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> we muſt all die, at one time or another: and if my dayes were ſhortned ſooner then thou wiſheſt, what remedie canſt thou finde againſt the will of the <hi>Heauens?</hi> Then content thy ſelfe with my death, without making me die againe, through the vnpleaſant report of thy ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>Liue then, liue long and happily, to the end I may die the more pleaſingly. And here I moſt earneſtly pray, deſire, and adiure thee, by our former mutuall loue, by all our chaſt pleaſures, by our ſacred band of wedlock, and by the ſelfe-ſame affection which maketh thee ſo heauie and ioyleſſe for mine occaſion, ſeeke not to offer any violence vnto thy faire ſelfe, after I am dead. Speake (my ſweet <hi>Charge</hi>) wilt thou giue me thy word, as thou haſt held me deare, to hold this promiſe with me?</p>
               <p>Ay mee, I ſee thou diſdaineſt to anſwere me, as vnwilling to yeelde vnto this my laſt requeſt. Oh moſt diſconſolate, and comfortles my death. And wilt thou then (mine onely ioy) refuſe to graunt me this my laſt boone, which I ſo earneſtly begge of you?</p>
               <p>Thou that for my ſake art willing to leaue this world, and who of late didſt pleaſe to offer it vnto me to ſaue my life; Be not ſo vnkinde now, nor offer me this iniurie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me in this point, otherwiſe, I proteſt, I will curſe my byrth, my cruell Fortune, and the froward <hi>Heauens</hi> themſelues.</p>
               <p>Speake then (ſweet Spouſe) for till then I forbid thee, to touch my dying face and lippes. Ah ſpeake yet at length, and I beſeech thee, be content with the helliſh paines which I endure to leeſe thy companie, without aggreuating any more, my more then endleſſe torments.</p>
               <p>Ah cruell Husband, replyed the penſiue Princeſſe, what offence haue I done thee? what iniurie haue I committed againſt thee? and how haue I wronged the bands of our ſacred marriage, that thou ſhouldeſt forbid me thy preſence? Where is now the time, in which thou haſt ſo much deſired to haue me about thee? Where are thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full careſſes, thoſe ſweet embraces, and thoſe affectionate kindneſſes vſed vnto mee of late, that thou ſhouldeſt now, thus reiect, condemne, and diſdaine me? If I am vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thee, then why diddeſt thou accept of me as thy companion and friend? And if I haue not merited to follow thee, then why haſt thou ioyned my ſoule ſo ſtrictly vnto thine? Thinkeſt thou I would be thine liuing, and would not be the ſame vnto thee after thou wert dead?</p>
               <p>My deare Lord, remember, that ſince I firſt was wedded vnto thee, I haue alwayes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled thy commandement, and that I ſerued and obeyed thee, and thy will in all things. In leiu of which perfect obedience, graunt mee (once) what I ſhall deſire of thee. But if thou wilt not, not onely be content to leaue mee a moſt wretched Creature after thy departure, but alſo to make me more miſerable, wilt not permit me to follow thee, then to render a new proofe of my great affection towards thee, for the great good will I haue alwayes had to be dutifull vnto thee, and to ſatisfie thy dying Spirit at this houre; Behold I here vow, not to lay any violent hands vpon my perſon, but to attend with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, vntill it ſhall pleaſe the Deſtinies to call mee vnto thee from hence. Then my kinde Loue, anſwered the Knight, let me embrace thee once againe cheerfully: and let me kiſſe thee once more, ſince thou art ſo pleaſing vnto me.</p>
               <p>O how much doe I acknowledge my ſelfe beholding vnto thee? how bleſſed doeſt thou make my death, and how willingly doe I depart from out this world? And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt made me this faithfull promiſe, I moſt humblie beſeech thee, to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in remembrance poore <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> thy loyall Husband.</p>

               <p>Farewell my good Friends, and faithfull Seruants, whom I deſire and commaund, to honour and make account of my deere Ladie and wife, as you would of mine owne ſelfe, if I were liuing: whom I know will not be vnmindfull of you, for your good ſeruices done vnto mee. And ceaſe you your womaniſh teares, for not with effeminate teares, but with ſhrill Trumpets, and warlike Drummes, the coarſes of braue Souldiers are vſed to be conducted vnto their graues. Once more farewell my ſweete Princeſſe. Remember what thou haſt promiſed vnto mee, and <hi>LORD</hi> receiue my ſoule into thy heauenlie King.</p>
               <p>Alas, this word <hi>Kingdome,</hi> hee could not throughly pronounce. Death with one ſtroke, cutting off his voyce and his life, both together at once. But why hold I you ſo long with this Tragicall diſcourſe? or what ſhould I report vnto you the vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſorrowes of diſpairing <hi>Iustina,</hi> when ſhee ſaw her noble husband giue vp the laſt gaſpe in her armes?</p>
               <p>I will now be briefe. After the Princeſſe found <hi>Alfonſo</hi> dead, ſhe remembred her pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vowe vnto him, and therefore ſought neither venim, ſword, nor ame other extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ende her dayes; but hauing ſweetely embalmed his carkaſſe, and placing it in a monument of Chriſtall, becauſe ſhe might the better behold it; ſhe neuer departed from the ſame, vntill that after a certaine time, what with hunger, ſorrow &amp; griefe, ſhe finiſhed her wearie and loathed life. Her faſting and weeping, had ſo chaunged her, as her nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſeruants and acquaintance ſcarce knew her.</p>
               <p>Now had ſhee (no more) that ſweete face, for the beautie of which, ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had ſo often combatted and fought, nor were her eyes ſuch, as had rauiſhed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſoules, neither was her haire, that paſſing golden haire, whoſe treſſes had ſerued for nets, to catch and intrap the Courtlieſt and greateſt hearts that liued: And to be briefe, ſhe was no more that faire and louely <hi>Iuſtina:</hi> who indeed had no need of ſuch comely fauour, when her onely deſire was to die.</p>
               <p>Her face and cheekes were now become pale and yeallow, her eyes darke, and ſunke deepe into her head, her haire fowle, vnkempt, and almoſt all torne off, her breaſts drie, and leane, her armes ſhrunke and brawnfallen, her handes without fleſh, or whiteneſſe, and finally, ſhee reſembled the very portraiture of a Ghoſt, or rather of Death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In this miſerie did ſhee liue ſome fewe moneths, when at the laſt, perceiuing the date of her life to be expired, ſhe came vnto the Tombe, where taking the embalmed carkaſſe vp, and embracing it in her armes, ſhe vſed theſe pittifull ſpeeches vnto it, as followeth.</p>
               <p>O ſole remainder of all my good Fortunes, O onely chiefe treaſure of all my goods, O ſole pawne, furuiuing of my true Loue, the onely comfort I haue in theſe my langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing griefes, and the goodly bodie, which ſometimes reuiued the faire ſoule inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein, which now liueth in eternall glorie for euer.</p>
               <p>To thee I appeale, as the onely thing which I moſt loue, honor, and praiſe, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to aſſiſt me at mine ende, and to beare witneſſe with me, that I haue kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe moſt faithfullie. As thou (when thou diddeſt die) wert willing that I ſhould not malice or annoy thee at thy death; So let not mine, (I pray thee) be any way diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto thee.</p>
               <p>All whatſoeuer thou diddeſt craue, did I yeeld and accord vnto: then blame me not, if hauing performed what I proteſted, I come vnto the Heauens to finde thee. In thy life time I haue liued, for feare to diſpleaſe, but now thou liueſt no longer (faire and beautifull Coarſe) and that I haue taken order for thy buryall, what thinkeſt thou ſhould keepe me heere any longer? It is reaſonable I ſhould die, ſeeing I can now no longer liue, and that I goe to make a ſearch for thee (moſt chaſt ſoule) in what place ſoeuer thou art.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:15406:47"/>
               <p>Die then (ſorrowfull <hi>Iuſtina</hi>) and (leauing of to lament,) change theſe thy reares, thy miſeries, and cares, into this eternall repoſe, where reſteth thy husband quietly. I haue liued but too too long, and my miſerable life, hath bin too irkeſome vnto me. It is (now) more then high time, to make an ende thereof (and making an ende of my ſelfe) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue my ſelfe vnto him, who whilſt he liued, had commaund ouer my ſoule. Thriſe bleſſed <hi>Inſtina,</hi> to be quit and rid of theſe vnſpeakable torments, to liue in euerlaſting quietnes, which is the onely hope of the miſerable. Let vs goe then, let vs goe, &amp; I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech that great God (who as a iuſt Iudge of the innocencie of our hearts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſecrets of our thoughts) to open that ſacred gate vnto me, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto his faithfull children. This ſaid, ſhe kiſſed the dead coarſe of her husband againe, giuing charge vnto her Gentlewoman, to enterre and burie her body hard by his ſide: that done, ſhe layeth her ſelfe along by the ſame, which ſhe ſtill embraceth: and hauing dreſſed her head, and apparelled her ſelfe for the ſame purpoſe, ſhe rendied vp her ſpirit: A ſpirit, right meritorious, and worthie of eternall glorie. Her body according vnto her laſt will, was buried in the ſelfe ſame ſepulcre which ſhe had cauſed to be made for her husband before.</p>
               <p>Herewith <hi>Coribant</hi> held his peace, being hindred to ſpeake any more, by reaſon of his teares, teares which bereſt the others of their voyces, who without being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe any more one with another, for that time departed, euery one to their ſenerall homes, ſo to paſſe away the darke and gloomie night.

               <p>This Riddle was interpreted to be corne, which being ſowne in the earth, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming dead, caſteth forth a greene blade, and in time groweth to be ripe, in deſpite of all ſtormes and foule weather whatſoeuer; It nouriſheth mankind, and therefore is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them as a father, not forbearing for all that, to reape him in Harueſt, to threſh and grinde him, and ſo to make flower thereof, which he had rather ſhould be done, then to be ouer long kept, for many times it groweth muſtie lying in garners.</p>

And what deepe ſlumber, take from him the continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his diuine <hi>Diana?</hi> his ſpirit being alwaies troubled, as well in the night, as in the day, and therefore far more miſerable then the bruite beaſtes. For whereas they repoſe themſelues (ſometimes) from their trauell, he (alwaies) laboured, and was (ſtill) in paine, he plainely perceiued the day beginning to lighten the hollow giering vault of heauen, he viewed the glorious Sunne, to gild and adorne the Roſeall skie: and he beheld beautious <hi>Anrora,</hi> to weepe drerie teares, for the death of her deare ſwarthie child; yet all theſe brought no comfort vnto his griefes.

               <p>Scarſe did the breake of day appeare, when this Swaine ariſeth from his bed, running vp and downe the Deſart, and ſearching for ſome fit place, where he might bewaile his ſorrowes at the full. At length he entreth into a huge deepe Caue, enuironed round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with ſharpe brambles, and pricking bryars, able to terrifie and affright any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely ſuch as ſeeke for death, whom wretched and wofull Caitiues feare not at all, becauſe euery houre they feele farre worſe plagues then death it ſelfe: and for that it is rather a pleaſure then a torment vnto them, to exchange their euill for good, and to leaue a ſowre and ſeuere Maiſter, to follow and ſerue one that is milde, and debonaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcas</hi> then being gotten into the bottome of this darkeſome Dungion, after he had for a certaine time bene mute, and as one falne into a ſound, in the end, breaking as it were out of a dead ſleepe, he began thus to complaine. Ay me, Alas! What might I thinke to be the reaſon, or cauſe of the miſerie and vnhappines of man? Is it the heauens, that iealous of their good fortune, ſcourgeth them with ſo great cruelties? Or is it their ſinnes, which prouoketh the anger of God, forcing him to ſtretch out his threatning hand againſt them? No doubt it is this laſt, for ſinne onely and wickednes, firſt opened the gate to death, that he might come in amongſt vs, and ſo ouerthrow vs. It is for the puniſhment of ſuch offences as we commit againſt the holy One, that we are perſecuted with peſtilence, famine, and with warre. So was <hi>Dauid</hi> plagued for his fault; and <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> with fire ouerthrowen. So were the <hi>Niniuites</hi> threatned: &amp; ſo was <hi>Ezechias</hi> admoniſhed to repent. O thriſe happie the Godly, who proſper like the fruitfull Lawrell, and poſſeſſe in peace, that land, which is taken away from the wicked with tempeſtious lightning and thunder. For ſo was the good <hi>Abraham</hi> bleſſed, and ſo (after his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was the righteous <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> with many moe beſides.</p>
               <p>But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, moſt vnfortunate are the wretched wicked ones, becauſe they grudge and repine, in that they ſuffer for the faults they haue committed, whilſt they are ſtung with Serpents from the heauens: as were the Hebrewes heretofore, when they began to

For, Is it not as eaſie a thing for a man to doe good as euill? when as in doing good, he enioyeth the happie and bleſſed content of the quietnes of his minde, without being troubled, either with the feare of the lawes, or the doubt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or ſlaunder.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he doth not dread death, for he withdraweth himſelfe from other hazards, whilſt he meditateth vpon the ſame; whereas Theeues and Murtherers, in robbing and killing, euery houre incounter therewith, before they are aware. But ſay it hapneth vnto them, yet doe they receiue it moſt meekely: for ſweet and bleſſed is the death of the iuſt, that die in the Lord; where, that of the wicked is hatefull and abhommable. Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then and gentle, are the commaundements of the higheſt, which his Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> approueth in theſe words; Keepe his commaundements, and you ſhall find them, to be neither troubleſome, hard, nor difficult to obſerue. They chaſe away, hot boyling Auarice, which burneth men with her vncharitable coldnes; they baniſh all mortall am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which weareth away the yeares of man before his time is come; they take from them, all murther and robbing, which ſtifleth the necke of the wicked with an infamous corde; they ſmother and kill adulterie, which laieth hold as well vpon the health of man, as on his honour: and to conclude, they extirpe and roote out, all thoſe vices which are deadly enemies, as well to the bodie as to the ſoule. By which we ſee, his lawes are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſweet, yea, and moſt profitable and neceſſarie for the health and contentment of mankind; which was the cauſe, the other Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> calleth the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eternall <hi>Iehona,</hi> a godly, iuſt, and ſacred commaundement; it being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of Iuſtice, the puritie of our liues, and the very eſſence (as it were) of all equitie, peace, and goodnes; For what croſſes ouerthwart the ſoules of the godly, who delight in no other thing, then in the law of the Lord?</p>
               <p>And what great and grieuous courſes doe trouble and diſturbe the conſciences of the wicked, who take a pride (as it were) as did <hi>Remus</hi> ſometime in leaping ouer the walles of <hi>Rome</hi>) to exceed &amp; goe beyond the bounds of the diuine ordinances of God? which, becauſe they are not hard to be accompliſhed, are not the cauſe of our ſinnes, and ſo by conſequence, are not the occaſions of our miſeries: For we may liue well, if we will, and liuing well, (and walking rightly in the commaundements of God) we may taſte of all happines, without once, as much as feeling the ſtroke of his heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the ſame ſort did God ſpeake vnto <hi>Caine,</hi> ſaying; If thou doeſt well, thou ſhalt be recompenced for thy well doing: and if thou doeſt ill, thy ſinne ſhall be preſently knocking at thy gate: that is to ſay, the puniſhment thereof ſhall not ſtay long, but it ſhall ſeaze vpon thee, for doing ſo badly. But vnder thee, ſhall the deſire of ſinne be ſubiect, and ouer it, ſhalt thou commaund; So that, if ve be ſcourged &amp; plagued, we muſt impute it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our owne faults; or we may auovd and leaue to ſinne ſo wittingly (as we doe) if we will, and ſo our plagues will ceaſe; but by reaſon we giue ouer our ſelues too too licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vnto the ſame, and like beaſtly Swine wallow ſtill in this filthie puddle, we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the heauen from aboue.</p>

               <p>Thrice bleſſed (then) is hee, that hath not tranſgreſſed the ſacred lawes of GOD:<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> which neuertheles, he hath not done (thinking thereby to reape reward, for his ſo well doing) for had hee done otherwiſe, he had bene tortured and afflicted with many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. That famous <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> one of the nine Worthies, followed this aduiſe, when he ſpake thus vnto the children of Iſraell: <hi>Worſhip ſuch Gods, as you list your ſelues, it lieth in you, &amp; is in your owne power and autoritie, to ſacrifice vnto ſuch as you pleaſe: As for my ſelfe, and all my familie, wee will acknowledge none for true God, but the HOLIE GOD, of our fore-fathers, Abraham, Iſaack, and Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, it is in vs to doe good or euill: as it is in the power of the Traueller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to follow what company hee pleaſeth, of all the reſt he meeteth, whileſt he goeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on his Iourney. If we ſhall worſhip the true God, as <hi>Ioſuah</hi> did, we ſhall liue hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pily, as did our predeceſſours before vs: but if we ſhall come to be ſeruants vnto Idols, then ſhall our offences open the doore, and make way for our afflictions and miſeries, bringing vs (at laſt) vnto vtter deſtruction for euer. For our God, hath preſented vnto vs, both good and euill. Yet doeth he ſay, <hi>Chuſe the good,</hi> (onely) <hi>that thou and thine may liue in rest and quietneſſe.</hi> Which was the reaſon that our bleſſed <hi>Sautour</hi> forgaue the ſinnes of <hi>Mary Magdalaine</hi> the repentant, for that (ſaid he) <hi>ſhe choſe the better part, which could neuer be taken from her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ſeruant that doeth ill againſt the conſent of his maiſter, can he iuſtly complaine,<note place="margin">An example.</note> when hee is puniſhed for his faults? If ſo, why then, (ſeeing we make choyce of ſin and iniquitie, and God ſcourgeth vs worthilie for the ſame) doe wee murmure and repine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? when we our ſelues, and not he, are the authors of our owne misfortunes, in that we commit thoſe ſins, which are the firſt motiues &amp; occaſions therof? God, who in his owne nature, is vncapable of ſin, &amp; who can no way receiue the accident of vice, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the author of our offences: otherwiſe, he himſelfe ſhould ſinne, (which to thinke, were meere blaſphemie) and ſinning ſo, he ſhould become the ſinner, and not wee, who ſhould be, but onely the ſimple executioners of his faults: Being a ſinner, he could not be God, no more then pure white, can become coale black, becauſe God and ſinne are ſo much contrary and different, as they can neuer be in one ſelfe ſubiect, nor one agree, or like of the other. Againe, if God ſhould force me to commit ſin,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> how then could he iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh me? For can that Lord rightly puniſh his ſlaue, who by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement hath don that fault, for which he is corrected? In like manner, what iuſt colour can God haue, to inflict puniſhment vpon vs, if he himſelfe hath not only perſwaded vs vnto the ſame, but alſo hath conſtrained &amp; vrged vs (as it were) perforce to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit this ſin, for which he doeth plague vs. Beſides, God hath not created man to be damned, or loſt, hell (being ordained only for diuels) neither <hi>will he the death of a ſinner, but rather that he liue &amp; repent. For if you your ſelues will</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>) <hi>harken vnto my voyce you ſhall eate the fruits of the earth in peace, without being touched with any kinde of miſerie.</hi> It (then) lieth in vs, to be fortunate and happy, in abſtaining and forbearing from ſinne: for our fore-fathers were bleſſed, and liued in all tranquillitie, &amp; peacefull reſt of the ſpirit, as long as thy abſtained from doing what was ill: but when they tooke once a contrary courſe, then were they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and plunged in an infinitie of miſeries: As the <hi>Iewes</hi> were ſlaine, ranſomed, and carried away (as captiues) by the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Kings, when they had prouoked God againſt them, by reaſon of the hainouſnes of their faults, and had purchaſed his iuſt indignation and diſpleaſure againſt them. It is our bad and leaud life, and not God, that bringeth vs into ſo manie miſeries. Who (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) is a God that hateth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, a God that hath not appointed death for man, and ſo mercifull, as hee taketh no delight in his vtter ruine and euerlaſting damnation. For with his owne proper mouth, thus did he ſpeake vnto the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Hieruſalem, Hieruſalem, how often would I haue gathered thee together, as the henne doth her chickens vnder hernings, but thou wouldeſt not?</hi> And as by our wicked behauiour, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the wrath of God againſt vs, ſo by doing well, we many times hinder &amp; aſſwage his anger and his plagues, which he menaceth and threatneth to ſend vpon vs. So did the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> by their hearty praiers &amp; vnfained repentance, change and alter the diuine will and purpoſe of God, breaking off that which hee had meant to haue done, which as it is comminatorie, ſo it is not (alwayes) neceſſarie, it ſhould be put in practiſe.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:15406:51"/>
               <p>So the good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi> by his contrite penitence, &amp; by his earneſt ſupplications, hindered the Almighties determination, which threatned him, that he ſhuld die within 15. dayes after, prolonging &amp; lengthening his life, whole 15. yeares more. And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> (ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times) through his earneſt intreaty, withdrew the predeſtination of God, which was then reſorute, and roſolued to ſuffer the <hi>Iewes</hi> to periſh, being then in the wildernes, and murmuring againſt his holy Name. But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we be not of the number of the Elect and choſen of God, yet let vs behaue our ſelues ſo, as we may be of the ſame:</hi> meaning by theſe his words, that if we liſt, we may ſaue our ſelues. Then ought I, to fret and fume againſt the ſtarres, or murmure and repine againſt the Heauens themſelues? No, God forbid, ſince my faults and not they, haue bene the authors of mine owne misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Had I not ſinned, I had not felt the leaſt touch of theſe troubles, that thus torment mee: I had not bene ſo wretched as to haue bene deſpoiled of that little mercie &amp; grace, which I had of the Almightie: I had not bene driuen from mine owne houſe, baniſhed from my Countrie, exiled from the preſence of my deareſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, nor ſcourged with the ſharp whip of extreme want and pouertie: Neither had this my predeſtinated diſaſter (which ſtill followeth me, vnto mine vndoing) bene able to haue croſt mee in all my deſignes, as it doeth (euen at this houre) and will doe continually. For alas, how little would I eſteeme of my loſſes, and of mine exile (ſince he cannot be termed a <hi>Bandite</hi>) who is welcome amongſt the wiſer ſort, and who (yet) hath ſome friendes left him) were it not for this my hard Deſtinie, which as a ghaſtly <hi>Furie,</hi> doeth ſtill haunt and follow mee. But I ſee, I ſee, (as in a glaſſe) my miſerie to be ſuch, as it will neuer be ſeparated from mee: and I perceiue but too well, that Deſtinies may be foreſeeue, but neuer can be preuented.</p>
               <p>As the Shepheard was (thus) pittifully lamenting vnto himſelfe, behold, hee might perceiue two terrible roaring Lyons, to come directly towards the Caue, wherein he had gotten himſelfe, it being the ordinary denne, wherein they vſed to harbour, which when hee ſaw, he quickly ſtarted vp, drawing forth his ſword, with intention to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; to make them buy his fleſh dearely: but they without ſo much (as once) offering to hurt him, gently paſſed by him, moued as (I geſſe) with his more then wofull miſery.</p>
               <p>They being gone, he came forth from his melancholike Cell, and as he was walking thus alone, the dolefull Nymph <hi>Orythia,</hi> his old (yet loyall Louer) met him by chance, who was comen (euen into this wildernes) to finde him out. After ſhe had ſaluted him, ſhee intreated him to ſit downe vpon a greene banke, couered ouer with ſhadowing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and to heare a certaine Sonnet, which ſhee had made in remembrance of him.

               <p>The Nymph hauing ſo ſaid, ſodainly departed, running as ſwiftly into the woods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, as the light Hinde, leauing the Shepheard all alone, who was as much amazed at her ſpeech, as is the way-faring man, when in his trauaile, he ſeeth the Thunder-bolt of heauen, to fall vpon ſome proud Rocke, breaking the toppes thereof, with his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble flaſhie blow.</p>
               <p>Long was hee not in this browne ſtudie, but that the olde man, (wonderfull ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt) to vnderſtand the diſcourſe of his troubles, came to ſeeke him, whome hee thus beganne to accoſt.

               <p>I know thou haſt not forgotten, how thou haſt plighted thy promiſe, to report vnto me thy misfortunes, and thy Loues.

               <p>Scarſe was I come out of mine infancie, &amp; growen a ſtripling, my chinne (not yet) bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the mark of a man, when <hi>Loue</hi> enrolled me for one of his band, forcing me to loue, before I knewe what liking meant: wherevpon, I beeing young in experience, and leſſe practiſed in knowledge, began to ſet my ſelfe to ſchoole, to learne the hardeſt ſcience in the world.</p>

               <p>Long time did this faire maide enioy my loue, till (mine eyes being dazeled with the renowme of the moſt famous <hi>Iulietta,</hi>) I longed (exceedingly) to ſee her, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme for truth, the ſacred report, which her rare perfections range of her, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the countrie: whereupon I reſolued to ſee her, yet (ſore) doubting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſo rare a thing, as the tender Eagle doth the face of the Sunne.</p>

If <hi>Magdalis</hi> was rich, and honourably deſcended, yet this farre paſſed her in theſe accidences, eſpecially, in wiſedome, and in learning, with other rich qualities, aswell of the bodie, as of the minde.

In all which ſpace, my Muſe did nothing elſe, but chaunt forth her ſacred praiſes, the rare Thewes, and exquiſite parts of this louely Shepheardeſſe being her Subiect, and the onely efficient courſes of all her writings; whilſt ſhe in the meane time, diſdained not (oftentimes) to anſwere me. For ſhe hath (alwaies) fauoured and reſpected gentle and towardly ſpirits, not that I am one of the ſame number, but becauſe ſhe made account of mine, as if they had bene ſuch indeed, they ſtill producing, and bringing forth ſuch fruits, as were to her glorie, her honour, and contentment.</p>
               <p>If the name of the <hi>BERGERIES</hi> of <hi>IVLIETTA,</hi> haue (by chaunce) come vnto thine eares, then maiſt thou gather the truth of my ſpeeches, by the report thereof, and eaſilie perceiue thereby, what dutious reſpect, and ſolemne ſeruice, I moſt religiouſly vowed vnto this faire and learned virgin. But as the heauens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> cannot (alwaies) continue in one, and the ſelfe-ſame courſe, but euer changeth and diuideth themſelues to an other forme; Euen ſo, the misfortune, or rather the puniſhment of our ſinnes, oppoſed her ſelfe moſt cruellie againſt the chaſte continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of my moſt modeſt and reſpectiue loues, ſecluding and ſeparating me, farre from my diuine <hi>Iulietta,</hi> of whom, (notwithſtanding all this) I carried away with me, the Tef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies and counterfait, ſhadowed within my ſoule, honouring her, as one, who had moſt power ouer me, and ringing loud peales, of her well deſeruing praiſes, ſo long, till at the laſt, Time, not onely changed my nature, but alſo my fortune and eſtate.</p>
               <p>And the ſooner to finiſh my ruine and ouerthrow, he forced me to trie ſo many wofull miſeries, ſcourging me with his ſeuere roddes, ſo ſore and cruelly; As (in the end) I forgot euery thing, and gaue ouer all; ſtudying onely what good meanes I might finde, to warrant and ſhield me, from the furie of my too too ſpightfull deſires, and to ſaue me from the ſharpe arrowes they darted at me, knowing that

               <p>Thus was I compeld to beate my witts, to find the way as well to preſerue and ſaue my ſillie life, laid in waite for, by many enuious perſons, as to conſerue that little which I held, through the grace of Fortune. But (hardly) could I keepe ſafe, either the one, or the other, looſing both my goods, and my bodie, which was drawne into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable priſon; where (yet for all this, ſuch was my good lucke) I found ſo much curteſie, as I might rather haue tearmed it libertie, then impriſonment, in that it was more profitable, then hurtfull vnto me, by reaſon I purchaſe many friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>After this had hapned, I wandred into euery place, as the Hart that ſearcheth his companion gone aſtray, without finding any one place, of ſufficient ſecuritie for this my wretched life.</p>
               <p>In the end, (when I had ſometime remained within a certaine Caſtle, with ſome of my friends) I chaunced to arriue at a goodly, rich, and great Cittie, which ſerued as a Sanctuarie vnto the miſerable, and as a ſafegard and refuge, for ſuch as were hardly deſtined, of which number I counted my ſelfe as chiefe. There did I finde my ſelfe, ſecure and ſafe, and therefore did I caſt mine anker on that ſtrand, wiſhing that I might make an end of my ouer-long paines, and too too weariſome peregrinations. Now whilſt I liued in this place, my Muſe was not altogether idle, one while in ſighing forth my hard fortune, an other while in lamenting my manifold and irrecouerable loſſes; and ſometimes Heroldizing the praiſes of thoſe, that maintained my poore life; ſo that I was not tongue-tide or dumbe, neither lay I long in ſilence, without doing ſome one thing or an other.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, it was my chaunce (one day) to walke into the Forreſts adioyning, as well to aſſwage my griefes, as alſo to put out of my minde, the thought of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances, where I found about a coolie fountaine, many faire Shepheardeſſes, who all daunced without feare, but onely for feare to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>Faire were they all,<note place="margin">An excellent deſcription of a faire virgin.</note> and (yet) not all liking vnto my minde, nor alike agreeable in mine eyes. Amongſt the whole troupe, one there was that pleaſed my fancie, aboue all the other; being taller in ſtature, ſtraiter of bodie, and fairer and goodlier then all the companie were. Her flaxen haire was daintily bound vp, placed vnder a curious Coife of fine Lawne. Her high forhead, goodly and broad. Her amorous eye-browes, ſomewhat blacke, ſeruing as an Vmbrill for her diamond-like-eyes. Her diamond eyes, cleare, quicke, and ſparkling; like vnto two Sunnes eles, which without hurting the bodie, pierced into the very ſoule, wounding moſt cruellie. Eares, which tooke priſoners, millions of hearts, the vertues thereof, drawing them moſt ſweetly vnto them. Eies, reſembling two ſacred lampes, being of force, to chaſe away all darknes, and to bring the bright day with them.</p>
               <p>Her witching lips, werered, like vnto the Cloue-Gilliflower. Her prittie mouth, faultleſſe and little. Her chaſt mouth, neuer touched of any, being as a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, moſt ſacredly reſerued for the ſeruice and honour of the celeſtiall Goddeſſes <hi>Diana.</hi> Her cheekes, vermillion right, reſembling the Sommer Roſe, adorned with a white lillie. Her dimpled chin, ſhort, round, and well made. Her throate was cleare Alablaſter, and her goodly breſt compoſed of pure Iuprie: in which, were ſweetly ſeated, two rich and pretious monuments of mountaine ſnow, diſdaining to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with any whitenes whatſoeuer. Her hands with azured veines, reſembled the pretious ſtones digged out of the quarrie of beautie. And to be briefe, her feete were ſlender and little withall.</p>
               <p>But O how perfectly faire wert thou in all poynts, beautious and louely <hi>Diana?</hi> How rare and gentle, was thy ſpirit? How ſtately and full of Maieſtie, thy gate? And how ſweet and pleaſing, thy more then angelicall preſence? If ſo admirable a Subiect as this, was not of ſufficient power, to enthrall and captiue me, when farre meaner and baſer (by ods) haue made the greateſt and braueſt perſonages in the world to ſtoope, I referre it vnto your owne ſenſures to imagine.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:15406:54"/>
               <p>O moſt ſeeret and maruellous, is the puiſlance of loue; No ſooner did I behold her, but I felt my ſelfe to be wholie changed and transformed into an other ſhape, as the Serpent changeth his skinne in the Spring-time.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of all whatſoeuer I had done before, was ſlipt and vaniſhed away, no otherwiſe then a waue of water, glideth ſwiftly in the Sea. I remained as one bound, and inchained: and yet alack, I could not chuſe but honour my bonds; neither could I withdraw, or retire my ſelfe from this deadly enemie of my reſt, which had depriued me alreadie as it were of my life, but ſtaied ſtill by her. Not vnlike vnto the fooliſh flie,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> that buzzeth (ſo long) about the candle, till at the laſt he burneth himſelfe in the flame thereof.</p>
               <p>Egerly, did I ſucke this ſweete poyſon downe my throate, enchaunting my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with the ſame. As the thriftie way-fairing man, drinketh with great greedines, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is preſented vnto him, to ſtaunch his drines. With great reuerence did I vſe, and (not a little) did I reſpect, thoſe arrowes, ſhafts, and darts, that were my death: ſo much fortunate did I imagine my ſelfe, to be vanquiſhed by ſo ſweet and faire an enemie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I once remoue mine eyes from her beautious face, no more then the captiue taken in warre, who looketh pittifully on him that hath taken him, vpon whoſe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth his deare deliuerance. The remembrance of all my fore-paſſed Diſaſters, was loſt with my libertie: this cruell wound, extinguiſhing all ſenſe of griefe of my other leſſer troubles, as a great euill doth expell and thruſt out a leſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus loue couereth all other miſeries, his heat, drying all others ſorrowes; and his force, aſſwaging all other loſſes whatſoeuer. And (as a great broad-leafed oke) hideth all kind of miſchiefes whatſoeuer. Like as we ſee that man, that hath loſt ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Euen ſo, doth it vexe my very ſoule, when I remember the rare and admirable qualities of my <hi>Diana,</hi> conſidering the great loſſe I haue thereby.</p>
               <p>And therefore (good Father) let me here leaue (I beſeech thee) without vrging me to proceed any farther; but rather permit me to goe my waies, that I may find out ſome cloſe &amp; frightfull Caue, where I may ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; enough bewaile this my ineſtimable loſſe. For the very thought thereof, doth take my voice away, pierceth quite through my heart, and diſturbeth all my wittes and ſences.</p>
               <p>Nay (forward) (good Shepheard) anſwered the earneſt old man. A worke halfe done, ought to be throughly finiſhed; yet in the meane time, thou maieſt if thou thinkeſt good, pauſe for a while here, and take vnto thee breath againe, letting paſſe this ſad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thy loſſes, ſince others haue had ill fortune as well as thy ſelfe.

                  <hi>Arcas,</hi> hauing reſted a while, began to proceed in his diſcourſe, when <hi>Philiſtell,</hi> and <hi>Corribant,</hi> comming vnto them (and hauing ſaluted them) ſat downe hard by them; whereupon <hi>Philiſtell,</hi> marking the countenance of the old man very wiſtly, and iudging him to be a Magitian, (as indeed he was) began thus to argue with him.</p>

And to be plaine with you, I thinke you are come hither, becauſe you may the more fitter put in practiſe your blacke Art here, and haue conference with the diuels. Now whether this your trade be lawfull or no, I faine would know the truth.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:15406:55"/>
               <p>That Maiſter will neuer account ſuch a one of his ſeruants,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> for faithfull and good, that ſhall goe about to ſeeke for aide of his enemie. If ſo, Thinke you then, that God can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it for good, that men, who are his ſeruants &amp; creatures, ſhall enter league, conferre, and be familiar with the diuels, his odious aduerſaries? Can the Iudge, take it for well, and not miſlike the reof, that any of his followers, ſhould aide and aſſiſt, comfort, and keepe companie with the criminall, whom for his faults he hath moſt iuſtly condemned to death? So likewiſe, if the diuels (who for their pride and wickednes haue bene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Almightie) are driuen and chaſed away from his diuine preſence, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe can ſuch men alledge for themſelues? who dare be ſo bold, as to preſume to come amongſt them, and to conſult with them? It is ſharpely forbidden, the good to conuerſe with the bad; the faithfull, to be acquainted with the Infidels; and the Chriſtians to haue truce with the Turkes. Then what alliance or league, can there be found betweene men, the children of God, and damned diuells, condemned from the beginning of the world for their moſt horrible offences? Long ſince, did God puniſh the Iewes moſt extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for offering to marrie with the wiues of the Heathen, deliuering them (for theirpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment) into the hands of their enemies: becauſe light and darkenes can neuer agree well together. And thinke you not, that he will giue ouer into the hands of the diuells, ſuch men as ſerue them, and are familiar with them; to the end they may be pumſhed, by the ſelfe-ſame ſpirits, whoſe executioners they haue bene in all hatefull vngodlines? Can any Father ſupport and beare ſo great an iniurie,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> that his ſonne ſhall follow and keepe companie, with ſuch a leaude and bad ſeruant of his, whom he hath driuen out of his houſe, in that he ſought to depriue him of the ſame, riſing vp (moſt rebelliouſly) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Euen ſo, can God take it well at our hands, that we, who are his children, ſhould compact and agree, ſeeking for the friendſhip and acquaintance of theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſeruants (the diuels) whom he hath throwne headlong, downe from out his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly manſion, becauſe they preſumed through their arrogancie, to be equall with himſelfe? If diuels are (by nature) wicked, and for their iniquitie are iudged vnto hell fire for euer; What then can men learne of them, but malice, enuie, euill, blaſphemie, and ſinne? Now theſe qualitiés being extreamely diſpleaſant vnto God (who is the mortall enemie of vice) how then can ſuch men ſufficiently excuſe themſelues, who haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch wickednes of Sathan and his angels?</p>
               <p>The old man, angred at the heart, as well to heare his Art blamed, as from being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the diſcourſe which <hi>Arcas</hi> had began, (halfe chollericke) replied thus.</p>
               <p>My friend (and ſtraunger vnto me,) I ſee well, thou haſt a taſt of thine old corrupt nature, ſeruing God, according vnto the groſe cuſtome of thiue Aunceſtors, &amp; only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one faſhion.<note place="margin">An excellent diſcourſe of Inchantuients.</note> Know then, there are diuers kindes of worſhipping of God. To take an oath, is forbidden by the diuine law; for feare, leaſt we fall into periurie: and therefore wilt thou ſay, we ought not to ſweare at all? So farre off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offending, are we by the ſame, that ſwearing truely, and before the iuſt face of vpright Iuſtice, it is a kind of adoration, and worſhip, which we render vnto God, becauſe we charge him (as it were) with the iuſtnes of the truth, or with the falſenes of the oath taken, in his holy name. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, wilt thou blame exorciſme of ſpirits, and the coniuring of them, which men doe to force them to vnderſtand, and giue care to that which is demaunded of them?</p>
               <p>The auncient Hebrewes, had not they Enchauntments, which chaſed away diuels, commaunding them in the name of God? Which our Sauiour his Sonne, when he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (here) vpon the earth, approued and allowed, as authenticall and lawfull?</p>
               <p>I tell thee, for thy learning, that there are two ſorts of Art Magicke (as there are two kindes of ſwearing) the one good, and the other bad. That is good, which is done by the diuine power alone, inaſmuch, as (onely) to him is the glory attributed, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer diuels Is not ſinne, a moſt wicked euill? and yet notwithſtanding, doe not the holy Doctors of the Church, will vs to follow and haunt the bad, vntill we haue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and driuen quite away, both themſelues and their vicious kind of liuing alſo? If ſo, thinke you then, that it is forbidden to conuerſe with ſpirits, when thereby they are bound more ſurely, and brideled more ſtraightly, as being vnable through their malice to hure manking, as they haue done?</p>
               <p>By whoſe vertue and authoritie doe diuels come out of hell? and in whoſe name, doe

No. For, they haue no authoritie one ouer the other: and euery Kingdome diuided within it ſelfe, ſhall (quickly) be brought to confuſion.</p>
               <p>Is it through the vertue of men? That is vnlikelyer then the other: for ſo farre be they off from commaunding ouer them, as they be farre inferiour vnto them in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and might.</p>
               <p>In whoſe name doe they then appeare? Euen in the Name of GOD; by whoſe diuine power, they come when they are called, which being imployed for the benefite of man, vnto this purpoſe, the whole glorſe thereof redoundeth wholly vnto him, hee being the ſole Author of this admirable worke. For it is no common matter, neither is it a trifle, or a thing of ſmall account, to force, conſtraine, or commaund Diuells: This beeing not able to be brought to paſſe, but by the Omnipotent might of God, the whole honor thereof, is attributed vnto him alone. So that to call vpon ſpirits through the power diuine (and not to employ them vnto any ill, but rather repreſſing, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vnder, (more and more) their wicked intentions, is properly an Act, or a kinde of worſhipping of God.</p>
               <p>The ſage <hi>Spartans,</hi> vſed to make their ſlaues drunke, and ſo to ſhewe them vnto their Children, to the ende they might make them flie that foule vice, deteſt drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and loue ſobrietie the better. Euen ſo, when one ſhall ſee theſe Diuells (to the ende, that by contemplating of their moſt horrible vglines, they may be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the ſacred Loue of God) Is it ill done of them ſo to do?</p>
               <p>But we (commonly) ſee, that men condemne that for bad, which themſelues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue, find fault with that Science, which they cannot attaine vnto, and diſpraiſe that, which they are no way worthie to enioy.</p>
               <p>As for the other kinde of <hi>Magique,</hi> which extendeth to conſult with Diuels, about the knowledge and Nature of wicked ſimples and hearbes,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> to make moſt damned poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hurtfull vnto ſo many Creatures, I cannot chuſe but confeſſe the ſame to bee paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ill, and that it is prohibited both by the Lawes of God and man.</p>
               <p>Neither can the one nor the other be good, anſwered <hi>Philistell.</hi> For as by the one, the diuine power of God is abuſed, ſo by the other, his holie will is (as it were) chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and controlled.</p>
               <p>What neede hath any man to conferre with helliſh Spirits, about the knowledge of things to come?

               <p>Then what occaſion haue wee, that we ſhould haue any recourſe or ſpeech with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, who are the mortall enemies of God? In this we ſhewe our ſelues, either to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt the diuine Bountie and Goodnes: or elſe, to haue no beliefe or confidence in his eternall and euerlaſting power.</p>
               <p>We are created of God, only to eleuate our minds in contemplation, to conſider, and to take knowledge of things preſent, and not to formalize and frame our ſelues after that which is to come: the knowledge of which, he his owne ſelfe refuſed to participate vnto his Apoſtles; &amp; therfore (except we would preſume to be wiſer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they) we haue nothing to doe to talke with Diuells, much leſſe to inuite or conſtraine them, to ſhew their puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance or malice, becauſe it is a kinde of vſurping ouer the power of the holie one, vnto whom is reſerued this correction or chaſtiſement, ouer theſe moſt damned Spirits. And to conclude, the hyſtorie of <hi>Saule</hi> may reſolue vs in this doubt, who loſt his ſoule, his life, and his Realme, for that hee forced a certaine Sorcereſſe to raiſe vp a Diuell, who had the forme and ſhadow of <hi>Samuel.</hi>

               <p>The other ſort of <hi>Magique,</hi> (farre more wicked then this) is ſo deteſtable and bad, as it ought not (in right) to be tearmed by this word (Science) becauſe it is an vſuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ill doing, which theſe Inchanters borrow of the Diuell, with the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to finde

No, for he had receiued ſuch great knowledge of God, as the vertue thereof, made him worthie to diſcourſe with ſpirits, and he himſelfe being willing to inſtruct vs in that notable perfect Art, left certaine writings of his behinde him, which are much ſought after by the Magitians now at this day, which are called <hi>SALOMONS KEIES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, by this we may gather, that if to haue communication or a parlie with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, had bene thought a thing deteſtable and vniuſt, <hi>Salomon</hi> had neuer talked with them, neither he himſelfe, would haue left vnto vs in writings, the meanes how to call vpon their names, or to diſcourſe with them.</p>
               <p>Father, Father, (replied <hi>Philiſtel</hi>) all theſe reaſons thou alledgeſt, cannot defend this thy bad cauſe, for neither ought we to follow <hi>Salomon</hi> in this, becauſe he made an ill end, hauing forgotten himſelfe (moſt miſerably) in the latter end of his age, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo horrible a fault, as the onely remembrance thereof, maketh my haire to ſtand vpright for feare) neither is thy cunning herein to be allowed, inaſmuch, as euery Science, that proceedeth not from God himſelfe, and is not drawne out of the ſacred fountaine of his immortall wiſedome, is not onely worthie to be condemned, but alſo meriteth to be rewarded with fire. That Magicke, ſhould be a Science ordained by God, thou canſt not maintaine, ſeeing that our Sauiour Chriſt neuer taught it, neither his Apoſtles, euer learnd it, as they did many other, good, holy, and iuſt Sciences. It is (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the Art of <hi>Eue,</hi> who beleeued what the Serpent tolde her, which was the cauſe, both of her ruine, and of ours.</p>
               <p>For tell me, I pray you, what grace or goodnes, can a man expect from his mortall enemie, being not giuen vnto any thing, by the corruption of his nature, but vnto blood-ſhedding, vnto wickednes, and vnto extreame crueltie? And ſo, what can one looke for, that may be profitable or good, to come from proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his angels of darkenes, they being the moſt deadlieſt enemies that may be vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde?</p>

               <p>Beſides, with what kind of payment, doe they paie themſelues (in the end) for the ſeruice which they haue done vnto men? Is it not, with the pretious price of their ſoules, which they ought to eſteeme more dearely, then all things (elſe) whatſoeuer? What doth it profit a man, to gaine all the kingdomes in the world, if he ſhall loſe his owne ſoale thereby? And who euer knew Magitians to die well, whoſe bodies often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue bene viſible ſeene to haue bene carried away by theſe Fiends?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ochozias</hi> King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> being ſicke onely becauſe he ſent vnto the Oracle of <hi>Belzebub,</hi> died moſt wretchedly, by the iuſt commaundement of God, how much (more ſeuerely,) had he bene puniſhed, if he had, had ordinarie conference with the diuels, when he was plagued with death, (onely) for that, he did (but) ſend, to aske ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and counſaile of him? But ſay, that God would forgiue this ſinne, yet tell me, I pray you, what truth and certaintie can you find, amongſt theſe illuding ſpirits? Firſt, they are (for the moſt part) ignorant of ſuch things, (as ſhall hereafter happen) as well as men be; And beſides, there is no truth in them, they being the firſt authors of lies, and thoſe that firſt taught vs to ſpeake vntruely.</p>
               <p>The poore <hi>Pamms</hi> themſelues (ouer whom they had ſo great power) for that they were Infidels, and abandoned of God, were continually mocked, deluded, and moſt groſely deceiued, by theſe malignant ſpirits. As witneſſe <hi>Pirrhus, Alexander,</hi> and thouſands moe. If then they would couſen their chiefeſt friends, and deareſt ſeruants, how much more will they goe about to deceiue ſuch as are their enemies, and who, as ſtrangers, giue but little credit vnto them?</p>
               <p>To conclude, the diuels are abiured enemies, againſt the righteous God himſelfe: and therefore, if we will be counted his true and faithfull ſoruiters indeed, we muſt not haunt, nor keepe companie with his aduerſaries; otherwiſe he will ſuffer them, to make a prey of our ſoules, as being vnworthie to appeare before his heauenly throne, becauſe we haue left him, and followed his foes. Such is the common end, of ſuch kind of people, who, whilſt they are liuing, ſeruing the diuels, doe the like when they are dead, they being rewarded with hell fire for their paines.</p>

And of this perfection, is Loue alſo the author, &amp; ſhall he then be called a Paine, and not rather the father of all ſcience and vertue? It is reported that the Muſes lighted one day vpon <hi>Cupid,</hi> keeping him within a border of flowers, but what could that border bring, but pleaſure and contentment vnto them, who had encloſed him within the ſame? The Muſes then honored Loue (as Conquerors are wont to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) placing vpon his head, a Crowne of greene flowers, as alſo the moſt wiſeſt in the world, haue offered ſcrifices vnto him, and to his celeſtiall Godhead, he being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt power amongſt the Gods that are in <hi>Heauen.</hi> Therefore, as I will not diſpute againſt him, ſo dare I not maintaine the cauſe of anie that ſhould not pleade in his behalfe.</p>
               <p>Herewithall the noble Knight held his peace, daunting very much the other Nymph that had written againſt <hi>LOVE,</hi> with theſe his liuely and excellent reaſons, which (ſhe thought) were of ſuch efficacie and force, that they could hardly be refelled by anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the olde man, who found himſelfe to be ouercome in the argument hee had with <hi>Philiſtell,</hi> as concerning Inchauntment and Sorcerie, willing to recouer his loſt honor, and to winne the ſpurres againe, in this ſecond diſputation, replied againſt <hi>Loue,</hi> in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot denie, but muſt needs confeſſe, that neither the ordinary trauailes that men vſe, nor the day lie labours which they vſually take, ought to be called Paine, for they are not (alwayes) of one force and nature, they paſſing away, quiet &amp; reſt comming in their place, as the Bowe, that cannot alwaies remaine ſtiffe and bent, wheras <hi>Loue</hi> onely (and that moſt iuſtly) deſerueth well this name of Paine.<note place="margin">An example.</note> The Laborer being payed for his worke, is contented, and taketh his reſt, the Husbandman, reaping his corne, taketh his eaſe, and liueth merilie after: but in <hi>Loue,</hi> what quietnes can be found? The poore drudge being wearie, repoſeth himſelfe in the night, ſo doth the tyred Traueller, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery beaſt whatſoeuer: but the Louer, what reſt receiueth he, either in the night or day? As the day is tedious vnto him, ſo is the night irkſome and ſadde, are they then freed of paine? The hungrie deſire neuer taketh quiet eaſe, but is in continuall paine: the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die couetous wretch, crauing ſtill golde, can neuer ſo much as ſlumber one winke: but the tormented Louers, leadeth a wotſe life (farre) then both theſe twaine, becauſe that good which he ſo much wiſheth for (and yet cannot obtaine it) ſeemeth more pretious vnto him, then all the Treaſures in the world.</p>
               <p>This doctrine, to <hi>KNOW: HIMSELFE,</hi> doeth him no good at all, for it cannot bridle his paſſions, keep in his hed ſtrong will, nor curb or conſtraine his ardent affections: and hee that cannot ſo doe, can neuer be quiet in his minde. Now the Louer coueteth alwayes, and couetouſnes is the child of paine: Is not then <hi>Loue</hi> the author of paine? and is it any thing elſe then meere griefe? Nay, although the Louer obtaineth that which he deſireth, yet for all that, his torments ceaſe not, becauſe he wiſheth ſtill to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the ſame: &amp; (for that the ſore doubt he hath to loſe that, which he hath obtained
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15406:59"/>with ſo much trauell) increaſeth the paine (ſtill) in him. The more golde the couetous myzer poſſeſſeth, the more continually he wiſheth,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> by reaſon the contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of man is without any limit: for being glutted with one kind of meat, he is greedy and hungry after an other. <hi>Diogines</hi> gaue out, that he was contented in his pouertie, but yet he was not, for he did hunt after vaine-glory. What ſhall wee then ſay of Louers? who not onely deſire to enioy their Loues, but alſo a continuation ſtill to gather them. And when, that length of much time, hath quenched this fire of loue, yet is there ſtill remaining ſome hote cinders, which preſently is ſet on fire with the wind of deſire, as a flame (when it is out) is reuiued againe, with the breath of the Ayre: the ſelfe-ſame <hi>Loue,</hi> beeing of this propertie, that after it hath a long ſpace troubled and tormented, ouerthrowne, and ruinated a man, with continuall paine and anguiſh of minde, in the ende it taketh away his life, whether he will or no. <hi>Achilles</hi> knoweth this to be true, who died for louing <hi>Polixena,</hi> being ſlaine moſt miſerablie amongſt his enemies. So doth <hi>Priam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Example.</note> the fooliſh loue of inceſtuous <hi>Paris,</hi> being the cauſe he loſt his life. And ſo doeth ſage <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> whoſe diſloyall wife cut his owne throate, becauſe ſhe might (the more ſafer) follow her diſordinate appetite. O what a pernitious thing is this <hi>Loue!</hi> &amp; how often hath it broke the plighted oath betweene man &amp; wife, making them amorous of ſtrangers, and cauſing them to diſdaine their nuptiall bed, with baſe and filthie whoredome? The good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> remembred this but too too well, who ſaw ſo often his wife, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer familar with ſo many: and poor <hi>Sampſon</hi> through loue, was depriued of his ſtrength; and made a ſlaue vnto others: that <hi>Sampſon</hi> I ſay, who was wont to conquer others, and to make them become tributaries vnto him.</p>
               <p>Againe, what faith and truſt is there to be repoſed in Louers, ſo cunning are they; and ſo readie to break their promiſes, and to ſweare falſly? that <hi>Iupiter</hi> ieſteth and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth at their proteſtations, as one that thinketh, they neither can nor ought to keepe them any longer then they liſt. For if men (now a daies) be ſo baſely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they will ſtrait yeelde vnto <hi>Loue,</hi> and that the deſire to enioy a little paltrie beautie, or a little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured complexion, compoſde of white and red, can make them to forget all dutie, all promiſe, and their owne good nature it ſelfe; What then ſhould hinder them, but that they may loue in another place, to endanger their Faith there, &amp; to ſweare, and forſweare themſelues againe? For hee that once committeth one ſinne, will eaſily fall into diuers other more grieuous: &amp; he that is knowne to be faultie in one thing,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> is reputed to haue offended in all the reſt. Beſides, ſo farre is <hi>Loue</hi> off, from ſtanding the learned in anie ſtead, that it hindereth and ouerthroweth their learning: for it is impoſſible for a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, both to loue, and follow his ſtudie together, becauſe the minde cannot in one and the ſelfe-ſame time, intend to hunt after diuers matters: and for that, the care which Loue engendreth, hindereth a wiſe man, in proſiting himſelfe at his booke, and doeth withdraw him from the pervſing and reading of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Againe, if there be neuer ſo meane and little aſcience in the world, but is ſufficient to imploy a mans whole life time, and all his wittes therein, and yet for all that, it hath neuer bene found, that any could euer ſound the deapth of the ſame: How (then) is it poſſible, that a wiſe man ſhould be able to follow both Loue and Learning, &amp; (to) prooue excellent in both? Nay then, I will ſee farther, and dare auouch, that the malice of the Serpent, not onely ſpoyleth and corrupteth the ſtudie of the wiſe, but alſo his condition and religion. And that this is true, great <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> can witneſſe, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelues, whom the loue of the <hi>Moabite</hi> women, which the trayterous King <hi>Balaac</hi> ſent vnto them, moued from the ſeruice of the true God, making them become moſt wicked and abhominable Idolaters. What greater miſchiefe can happen vnto a man, then to denie his God, his faith, his beliefe, and his religion: yea, and therewithall, to looſe all his wiſdome, and authoritie? If <hi>Loue</hi> (then) be the cauſe of ſo manie miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes vnto men, and bringeth them with him vnto them, is not he then, the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble author of our ruine, our perpetuall paine, and vtter ouerthrow? heeis farre worfe then all the poyſonous ſerpents of the earth, yea, then the Diuels of of hell themſelues.</p>
               <p>Not ſo, quoth <hi>Coribant,</hi> and therefore I pray you make a ſtop there: for <hi>Loue</hi> is not of that bad nature, neither is hee to be compared vnto ſuch wicked creatures, as you would haue vs beleeue: for were it not for him (whom you reuile ſo much) neither you,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15406:60"/>nor any man elſe could liue at all. That which maintaineth all things, and giueth life and force vnto them, can that be teatmed an euill ſpirſt? So farre off is <hi>Loue</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a one, as he hath made the Fiendes of hell themſelues, milde and gentle, when the faithfull <hi>Orpheus</hi> went downe thither, to bring backe his deare eſpouſe. That which doth not vſurpe vpon publike honeſtie, but hath reſpect vnto euery vertuous action, may it be called an enemie of Nature? <hi>Loue</hi> hath preſerued, both honor, reſpect, and vertue, then why ſhould anie blame him? The ſonne of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> falling in loue with his ſtepmother, choſe rather to be brought (euen vnto deaths doore) then to declare as much as his paſſion, for feare leaſt he ſhould haue offended the honor, reſpect, and the obeiſance of a Father, through the dutie of a louing Sonne. There is no doubt, but that man is to be commended highly, who rather conſenteth vnto his own death, ruine, and miſerie, then to commit a moſt notorious and vnnaturall fact. <hi>Loue</hi> forceth the Louer, to chuſe (rather) to die,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> then to perpetrate any hainous fault. Is <hi>Loue</hi> then the ſubiect of blame? <hi>Loue</hi> reſembleth wine, which taken moderately, and with meaſure, nouriſheth the bodie, but being vſed too exceſſiuely, it burneth and inflameth the ſame. Euen ſo <hi>Loue,</hi> being well and wiſely applyed, may bring much profit &amp; glorie, as it did vnto the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Sabines,</hi> who being ready to encounter, and to kill one another, they agreed ſo louingly, as (euer after) they were but as one bodie, or a Citie within themſelues. Indeed if it be ill imployed, then I muſt needes ſay, it may doe much hurt: but it is the Louer himſelfe that is in fault thereof, and not <hi>Loue.</hi> The grape of the vineyard, of it ſelfe is good, and was giuen for a nouriſhment vnto man, yet neuertheleſſe, man ſometimes dyeth, with taking ouermuch thereof: but is this the fault of the grape, or of him that abuſed the ſame? Is there any precious treaſure to be found, throughout the compaſſe of the wide and ſpatious world, that is to be compared vnto a loyall &amp; faithfull friend? What happier contentment can there be, betweene man and wife, then chaſt and perfect loue? The greateſt bleſſing that euer <hi>Mithr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Manie things are there (beſtowed vpon vs) by the <hi>Heauens,</hi> which of their owne natures are good, and yet the malice of man doth alter them, into a bad propertie: As weapons, with which they kill one another: Fire, wherewith they burne whole Cities and townes: Gold, with which vertue is corrupted: and the cloake of Religion, wherewith they couer their proud ambition, with many ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Yet although theſe things are (thus ill vſed) and wreſted by the corruption of man, we muſt not therefore ſay, they are bad of their owne ſelues: but rather, by reaſon of the malice of others. Euen ſo, <hi>Loue</hi> being perfect and good (in his owne proper nature) and of his owne ſelfe, be abuſed and made worſe, through the default of men; it is not he, but they, that are to be condemned for the ſame. Had <hi>Iupiter</hi> neuer loued, the earth had neaer bene clenſed, nor purged of ſuch monſters, as much did trouble it, for then the mightie <hi>Hercules</hi> had neuer bene borne. Marke I beſeech you, how much wee all are beholding vnto <hi>Loue.</hi> Many times when men fall a diſcourſing, and from words to quarrels, ſo farre is <hi>Loue</hi> off, from being the author thereof, as quite contrarie, (were it not for his preſence) contentious Diſcord would animate one againſt another, euerie one to murther his companion &amp; acquaintance: for where <hi>Loue</hi> is, there neuer is ſeene any diſagreement at all. And therefor is <hi>Loue</hi> the father of concord and peace, and not of brawling and ſtrife:<note place="margin">A Hiſtoriz.</note> yea, and ſo puiſſant and forcible is hee, as his power alſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to force wilde beaſts to be milde, as was that Lyon which was brought before <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperor, which in ſteed of deuouring the poore ſlane (who was flung vnto her, to ſtaunch her exceeding great hunger) gently fell downe at his feete, ſtroking him, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all the reuerence that might be, and louing him moſt deerely, by reaſon that this ſlaue (flying away from the ſeuere crueltie of his maiſter, and lighting into a wood, where this beaſt was, had pulled out a great thorne out of his foote, which moſt pitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie did grieue him. Now if brute beaſts are taught to loue, out of doubt then, ſuch men ſhall be much condemned, as will not follow the like example. The graue <hi>Spartans</hi> put in practiſe this counſell, to the intent to haue children, in as much as they imagined that ſuch as were begotten, through a firme and paſſing kinde of good liking, would prooue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15406:60"/>farre more valiant and couragious, then ſuch as were borne of the husband and wife, without louing one an other.</p>
               <p>And ſurely we ſee by experience, that ſuch children are more gallant, and of a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpirit, then thoſe that are brought forth into the world lawfully: whether it is either becauſe the loue of ſuch perſons is more affectionate and paſſionate, that are the cauſe of their byrths, or whether it be, for that they ſee by reaſon that they are Baſtards, they are depriued of their Parents inheritance, and therefore the more willingly thruſt forth themſelues to ſeeke their owne aduancement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iefpha</hi> the Iudge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> ſurnamed the Conqueror, that got the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> were of this number, with infinite other braue perſonages. So that by this, we may gather, that <hi>Loue</hi> not onely bringeth forth honor and profite vnto men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an vnſpeakable kinde of comfort withall. They that haue tryed the pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, can better iudge then I: For the delight that <hi>Loue</hi> affordeth, is ſo ſweete, ſo gentle, and ſo delightfull, as it is not poſſible to ſet downe, no, nor ſcarce to conceiue the ſame, in anie thoughts: So that in compariſon of that, all other mortall ioyes are but;<note place="margin">A Bompariſon</note> as it were, ſmall ſparkles, and like vnto litle ſtars in reſpect of this, which for the glorie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be compared vnto the ſplendent Sunne.

               <p>If it be lawfull for one to ſay ſomething, and to argue of that which wee cannot ſee, (as of a Deitie or Godhead) then muſt we reaſon by the effects of the ſame. But theſe which exceede our humane capacitie and conceit, giue vs a moſt certaine and ſufficient teſtimonie, that we ought to belieue, that there is a certaine puiſſance and power, farre greater then is our owne, which we cannot attribute vnto anie other then vnto GOD. As in a wildernes, the houſes there built, teſtifie that men be dwelling therein, becauſe they are the worke of mens hands. So may we ſay of <hi>Loue,</hi> and ſo it is with him, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath any perſon ſeene him, nor viewed him at any time; yet notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is able to talke and to diſcourſe of him, by reaſon of the wonderfull effects, which proceed from his diuine power and might. Where you ſay, that Children borne out of marriage, are valiant and couragious; At that I maruell nothing at all: for <hi>Loue</hi> being a Baſtard (as the ſonne of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>) cannot doe leſſe, then like, ſupport, and affect his brethren, they hauing the ſame beginning that he hath.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, (for all they haue ſome particular gift incident vnto them) yet are they (as illegitimate) depriued both by Nature, and by the Ciuill Law, from bearing any charge or office in the common-wealth, as their birth is contrarie vnto the cuſtome, as well of honeſtie, as of all ciuill order and Lawe. Therefore <hi>Loue</hi> is not praiſe-worthie in this point, for manie times hee confoundeth Right, and maketh a gallimalfrie, or a mingle-mangle of Iuſtice, bringing ſuch vnlawfull Brattes as theſe, to inherit with thoſe that are lawfullie begotten, either for default that they are not knowne, or taken to be ſuch, or elſe, becauſe their preſuppoſed father, will not publiſh them for Baſtards, for that he will not offend the honor of his wife.</p>
               <p>But ſay the world were freed from ſuch kinde of men, and that there were no more ſuch to be found: yet for all that, it ſhould be (neuer a whit) the leſſe honored, nor leſſe defended, I confeſſe and yeelde, that <hi>Loue</hi> is mightie, and of great power, in the procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch children. But as all Countreyes and Realmes (without the execution of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) are but plaine &amp; open theeueries, and robberies, liuing as licentious Outlawes: So <hi>Loue</hi> without reaſon and Iuſtice, is but a diſordinate appetite, trampling vnder his feete, all reſpect, all Iuſtice, and all Law, to ſatisfie and aſſwage his hote and burning paſſions.</p>
               <p>And how much <hi>Sumiramis,</hi> the nieces of <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Poppea, Agrippina, Faustina,</hi> and diuers others, haue bene condemned, for following ſuch kinde of <hi>Loue,</hi> and giuing ouer themſelues, moſt voluptuouſly, vnto all ſorts of people, you knowe as well as I am able to report. Where you ſay, that <hi>Loue</hi> is not the author of vice, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, who applie the ſame ill, and abaſe it, through the badneſſe of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I anſwer, that it is nothing ſo. For as the priſoner, cannot diſpoſe of him, who is his keeper, and holdeth him captiue: Euen ſo, men are ſo farre off from ruling <hi>Loue,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they would, that hee vſeth them as he liſt, holding them ſo faſt (in ſuch ſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15406:61"/>bands) as they can doe nothing but what ſhall pleaſe him. There is difference betweene him and wine: for a man may take heede if he will, that he drinke not ſo much, vntill he be drunke, but he cannot (ſo eaſilie) reſiſt Loue, in as much, as that reaſon being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt which is in man (vpon which preſently, Loue, as a tyrant ceazeth) he (can then) doe no more of himſelfe, he being conſtrained and compelled, to follow the will and commaund of him, that doth ſignorize ouer him. For if Loue were in the free libertie, &amp; at the deuotion and diſpoſition of men, and that they might imploy him as they ſhould thinke beſt, then would not ſo many wretched Louers, endure ſuch cruell torments and bitter anguiſh as they doe, but would quickly ridde themſelues from out his cruell hands.</p>
               <p>But (alas) they can no more get from him, then the poore bond-ſlaue, can get out of his chaines, except it pleaſe his Lord and maiſter. Therfore, we muſt not ſay, that men can order and bridle Loue at their owne pleaſures, turning him, to good or bad purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as they ſhall thinke beſt, when it is quite contrarie, (and as they ſay, <hi>Allo reuerſo</hi>) he playing the vſurping tyrant ouer them.</p>
               <p>In the end of your ſpeech (to make amends) you tell me, that this ſelfeſame Loue, maketh a perfect and an eternall league of friendſhip, betweene Gods and men, in ſuch ſort, as it forceth the husband to offer his life moſt willingly, for his wiues ſake, and that the wife, doth the like for the conſeruation of her husbands welfare.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Craccus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Similie.</note> who to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue his wiues life, ſhortned his owne. And as <hi>Alceſta</hi> did, who offered her ſelfe to die for <hi>Adentus</hi> her husbands ſake. Yet as ſharpe and ſtrong medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, engendred much danger and feare, yea and many times, are much hurtfull to the bodie of man, ſo Loue (during this amitie) bringeth forth many bad and vntowardly children, which alter and chaunge their mindes very much, and are not a little hurtfull vnto both parties: as the burning Iealouſie which ſo much galled poore <hi>Iuno</hi> long ſince, as the whoredomes, with which <hi>Venus</hi> defiled the bed of <hi>Vulcan</hi> her husband, with the number of Rapes vſed by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſuch like bad ſtuffe. So as you ſee ſo many euils to proceed, for one ſmall little good.</p>
               <p>But as he cannot be called a bountifull and liberall giuer indeed, who preſenteth and beſtoweth a ſmall trifle, to purchaſe huge and mightie riches. Euen ſo, Loue cannot be counted, neither good, nor healthfull, when for one (onely) good turne he doth, he yeeldeth forth ſo many ſufficient proofes, of his wicked and bad nature.</p>
               <p>In no one action, doth Loue merrit commendations, for he reſpecteth neither reaſon nor Iuſtice, and ſuch things, as are voyd of thoſe two qualities, can neuer deſerue honour, nor cauſe themſelues to be counted perfect: he is without reaſon, in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth neither law, nor kindred, friendſhip nor acquaintasce, no good turne, nor any kinde conſideration elſe, ſo as he may come to obtaine what he deſireth. One while violating and breaking the lawes of hoſpitalitie: another while, thoſe of marriage: and then, thoſe of parentage and kindred. He is without Iuſtice, becauſe he rauiſheth, and taketh away by force, that which is none of his owne, applying the ſame to his owne aduantage, as if it were his owne proper goods; raiſing and procuring, by theſe bad meanes, thouſands of brawles and brabbles, debates and quarrels, and continuall warres and battaile; In ſteed of ſeemely, and fitte exerciſes, he ſhould acquaint young men withall, he oftentimes maketh them ſo mad and furious, as they ſticke not to commit rapes, to offer violence, and to doe all the villainies that may be, thereby infringing the peace and lawes of the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Well may he be compared vnto the Snake, which the husbandman carried in his boſome to warme, it being nie dead for colde, which afterward went about to ſting him for his paines.</p>
               <p>So Loue, in requitall, and for amends vnto vs, for the honour we haue borne him, and becauſe we haue ſo curteouſly entertained him, ſtingeth vs with furie and rage, and with iniuſtice and miſerie, theſe being the fruites which he bringeth vs, and which are (as it were the precurſors and fore-runners, of a moſt wofull and wretched death, which end, (moſt commonly) lighteth vpon Louers: for furie is the daughter of ſorrow, and not of pleaſure, which our deſire doth ouermuch couet.</p>

               <p>The Shepheard hauing made an ende of his Tragedie, helde his peace, bringing vnto the whole companie, a kinde of mournfull and ſolemne ſilence, vpon the ricitall of the ſame, with a ſecret, ſtill, and inward ſorrow, for the lamentable end of <hi>Zirphir,</hi> and <hi>Sycambra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how miſerable are thoſe, who ſeeme as (it were) to feele their owne loſſes, through the recitall, and reporting of other mens mishaps, being as bad almoſt, as to awake the happie patient (ſleeping) by reaſon of his ſoporiferous potion, iuſt at that time, when the Chyrurgian beginneth to cut off his legge.</p>
               <p>Too too much doe I prooue it, find it, and trie it, to touch me to the verie quicke, (cried out) the ſighing <hi>Arcas.</hi> The misfortunes of euerie man, reuiueth mine owne, which (before) lay cloſely couered vnder the cinders of my former Diſtaſters.</p>
               <p>The remembrance of things proſperous, is nothing ſo pleaſant, as the recalling to minde, of what is vnhappie, is bitter and ſower. For the pleaſure thereof, hindereth the true knowledge of pleaſure aright: and ſo by the contrarie, the contrarie is the more to be commended.</p>
               <p>But, O how cruell then is the conceit, and apprehenſion of a mans euils? For the felicitie of the other, doth not oppoſe himſelfe againſt the crueltie of this thought: thoſe which are fortunate (being exempted) through the ioy they conceiue of their ill chances which are paſt and gone.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:15406:70"/>
               <p>Old <hi>Hecuba,</hi> when ſhee was captiue, rendred the memorie of her miſeries more cruell; by reaſon; ſhee (alwayes) thought vpon her happie time that was already gone: For one is not ſo much grieued to be wretched by Nature, as when he is brought downe ſo lowe by Fortune: and the cauſe is, for that wee are (naturally) borne to ſuffer, and that he accounteth not his ill hap to be vnſupportable, which he receiueth of Nature, in that he is accuſtomed to endure, and beare the ſame alwayes.</p>
               <p>But euen as where both Fortune and Nature abound in anie notable ſpirit, it is the more excellent, and accompliſhed for the ſame. So twiſe miſerable is hee, who (as my ſelfe) feeleth him ſelfe to be iniuried, both by Fortune and Nature! By Fortune, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſhipwrack of my libertie: of my Goddeſſe, and faire Miſtriſſe,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> and of the ſweete aire of my Countrey: By Nature, I hauing nothing in me, that can draw any commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for me, amongſt the learned, or win vnto me any credit, amongſt ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted rare and admirable perſons in the world.</p>
               <p>Then why loue I? or why ſhould I deſire to breathe any longer? Vnfortunate that Marriner, who arriuing ſafely into the Hauen, will needs venture againe, to thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into the tempeſts of the Sea, to drown himſelfe moſt wilfully, in the bottom of the waues. So fareth it with me, for after I had bene cruelly plagued with the chaſt loue, of the learned and famous <hi>Iulietta,</hi> I fell to loue the renowmed <hi>Diana;</hi> The fire of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being far more hotter then the other: but although this my firſt fault may be well pardoned, yet the ſecond falling againe into this error, is to be greatly doubted &amp; feared.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Arcas,</hi> thou ſhouldſt haue contented thy ſelfe, with thy firſt impriſonment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking to commit thy ſelfe afreſh, into a new captiuitie. But Souldiers in warre, may be taken three or 4. times, in that they be not of power, to withſtand the Conquerour: Euen ſo, if <hi>Loue</hi> hath ſo often taken me priſoner, what reſiſtance could ſo weake a wretch (as my ſelfe) be able to make againſt him? But vnluckie is that priſon, into which, wee vnwillingly enter: and ſo too vnhappie were my chaunce, if I ſhould be depriued of the diuine and chaſt loue of my <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reſemble that Captaine of warre, who complaineth of the paine he taketh, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for the trauails he endureth, grieueth at the perils he is ſubiect vnto, &amp; murmureth againſt warre &amp; warfaring, and yet (in the mean time) while he deſireth to returne home, he would take it far more heauily, if he ſhould be put from this painfull kind of exerciſe.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, moſt happie ſhould I thinke mine eſtate to bee, if (were I neuer ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) I could, with the loſſe of all other things, repoſſeſſe my libertie, as I had it before. For they liue (although but poore and needie) who are not ſubiect vnto any one, where ſuch as are ſlaues, liue not at all, (although they be full of riches) becauſe they are not maiſters of their owne liues, but be vnder the coutrolment of other.</p>
               <p>Leaue theſe vnneceſſarie and friuolous complaints (ſaid the old man) and follow the diſcourſe of thy Loues alreadie begunne. The minde that hopeth, is galled, when the hope of what hee deſireth, is prolonged with delayes.</p>
               <p>Tell on then, for it may be, thou ſhalt receiue comfort by thy ſpeech, and helpe,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> and aſſiſtance of thoſe, which ſhall heare thee: in as much, as what one mans will is ignorant of, another may know it: and he that ſeeketh remedie for his griefe, of the <hi>Maior</hi> part, in the end, findeth that he doeth the ſooner recouer of his diſeaſe. Therefore (good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) continue the courſe as thou didſt begin.</p>
               <p>Father (replied the Shepheard) tell me, I pray you, is it forbidden, the Traueller, who hath wandered out of his way, to reprehend and blame himſelfe, after he perceiueth that hee is faultie? Euen ſo, if I haue done ill, in beginning the recitall of my mis-fortunes, (the only remembrance whereof, doth aſtoniſh &amp; amaze me) can you be angrie with me, if I found the retrait, giuing ouer a ſubiect ſo lamentable, &amp; ſo far diffring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my deſire?</p>
               <p>Couet not I beſeech you, to know, and to be acquainted with that, which you cannot remedie, it being a caſe deſperate, and paſt recure: Or, if you will needs purſue mee, in my promiſe, then yeelde me a place fit for my Fortunes, finde me a place horrible, and ſadde, to the intent that my paines, my ſpeeche, and mine abode, may be conformable and alike.</p>
               <p>I will not ſticke with thee for that (anſwered the olde man) doe but follow mee, and I will bring thee to a Receptacle, very conuenient for ſuch a conceit as thou haſt.</p>

               <p>Come then, &amp; I wil lead thee, into the hollow bottome of a Lightning-blaſted-rock, which, for frightfull darknes, and darkſome fright-fulnes, is as bad as Hell it ſelfe: and therewithall, the aged man went before the Shepheard as a Guide, hee following his ſlowe ſteps heauie and ſadde:<note place="margin">A Smilie.</note> not vnlike vnto a young Childe, that followeth (aloofe) the partie that leadeth him to ſchoole, to tell ſome tale vnto his maiſter, for ſome fault that he hath done.</p>
               <p>Thus they two, leauing the reſt of their companie, walked all alone, toward this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure lodging, where onely horror doth inhabite: and beeing now come to the watrie Seaiſh ſhoare, they heard (vpon the ſuddaine,) one ſcriching out moſt pittiouſlie, and therewithall, might perceiue a ſadde and weeping Shepheardeſſe, to come running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, her golden Treſſes hanging about her eares, which the wanton winde blew heere and there. Her face was pale and blood-leſſe, like vnto the fall of the leafe, whilſt for want of breath, ſhe remained almoſt windleſſe, being hardly able to crie, or runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer. Vpon the ruddie Roſes of her lips and cheekes, and all along the white A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſter of her luory breſts, ſtreamed downe teares, like drops of peerleſſe deaw, iſſuing forth from her mournfull eyes, as betweene two valleyes, runneth a moſt ſwift flood of waters. Faire was ſhe and louely, although feare (at that time) had diſrob'de her of her beautie, and frightfulnes taken away (at that time) the vermillion Die, from her cheekes. In this ſort did ſhee flie away (as the Hinde doeth from the Hounds) being followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by ſixe tall and luſtie Theeues, all Pirates of the Sea, who hauing their naked ſwords ready drawne, purſued her hard, threatning to maſſacre her, vnleſſe ſhe ſtayed and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelfe vnto them. Alacke poore ſoule, what likely hood of helpe was there, in that vncoth place, to ſaue her ſelfe? but that the Almightie and puiſſant <hi>IEHOVA,</hi> contrarie vnto her hope and expectation, prouided meanes for her eſcape and ſafetie: giuing ſufficient proofe heereby, that hee not onely helpeth ſuch as truſt in him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, thoſe that are quite without hope, and (in a manner deſperate) of all ſuccour what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer.</p>
               <p>The olde man, moued with compaſſion, preſently tooke his booke, opened it, and red certaine Spelles in the ſame, whilſt rolling his eyes wildely, too and fro, the manner of his proceedings, being not ſo fearfull, as the caſting of his lookes, ſeemed to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, wherevpon the Rouers were forced to ſtand ſtone-ſtill vpon the ſuddaine,<note place="margin">An example.</note> as the Shippe that is caſt vpon ſome ſandie ſhelfe, can no way moue. Liueleſſe and ſenſeleſſe did they ſtand, as whilom did the Louers of <hi>Meduſa</hi> or as the companions of the Duke of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> the old man hauing changed them, ſome into Trees, ſome into Lyons, ſome into Tygers, and ſome into Wolues.</p>
               <p>A worthy puniſhment for their ſo fowle a fault. The Almightie God (ſometimes) ſeruing himſelfe, with others, skilfull in the ſame Science, as this old man was, as hee did with the three <hi>Magi,</hi> or Kings, that came to worſhip his <hi>SONNE,</hi> our onely Sauiour.</p>
               <p>But of this ſtrange aduenture, wee will talke, at a more conuenient time heereafter: Comming againe vnto the aged man &amp; the Shepheard, who followed onwards on their iourney, the one, mourning for the cruell execution he was ſo lately forced to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and the other ioyfull, hoping to find ſome comfort of the olde man, by reaſon of the admirable effects of his skill, which he had ſeene alreadie.</p>
               <p>In the end, they came vnto the foote of a Rocke, halfe-eaten, through the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, which oftentimes, had felt the furie of Lightning, and not ſeldome aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the choller of angrie <hi>Iupiter.</hi> On the top of this, (with much adoe they got) where they found a certain ſtraight and dark Caue, beſet with ſharp thorns and briars, &amp; ſenſles Serpents, Serpents turned &amp; changed by this olde man, into blacke and vgly ſtones.</p>
               <p>O place, paſſing fitte and conuenient, to report the miſeries of the melancholike Shepheard, which ſeemed (ſomewhat to come nigh vnto the horror of his paines, and to participate with part of his misfortunes, wherevpon the olde man ſaide thus vnto him.</p>
               <p>Speake gentle Shepheard, haue I not (now bene as good as my word with thee?) and is not this (thinkeſt thou) the ſtill Cell, where heauie ſleepe remaineth, and the dreadfull lodge of the fuskie daughters of blacke Night?</p>
               <p>Hither did <hi>Iuno</hi> come, to finde out drouſie Slomber, ſhee as then abiding here, when ſhe wrought ſo cunningly, that ſhe caſt <hi>Iupiter</hi> into a dead ſleepe, whilſt ſhe in the meane

               </p>
               <p>If this place be agreeable vnto thy mind, then onwards with that which I haue ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vrged thee to bewray, &amp; faile not to perform as much as thou haſt promiſed vnto him, who will ſhew what teſtimonies poſſible may be, of a gratefull mind towards thee.</p>
               <p>With all my hart (replyed kinde <hi>Arcas</hi>) for it is no loſſe nor trauaile, to ſeeke to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and ſatisfie, ſuch as wee are bound or beholding vnto, there being no remedie, but we muſt needes one way or other, cleare with them, who are our Creditors, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom we are obliged.</p>
               <p>Let vs then ſit downe (reuerend Father) &amp; giue mee leaue to take breath for a while, to the ende I may call to minde, and knit vp the broken threed of this my laſt diſcourſe with you. For (already) haue I told you (if you haue not forgotten the ſame) how <hi>Loue</hi> (againſt reaſon and iudgement) had quenched the affection I bare to <hi>Iulietta,</hi> mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing me (in ſteede of the other) to affect my <hi>Diana,</hi> as the Smyth maketh his coales more hotter, by flinging water vpon them.</p>
               <p>And to ſay truth, what is hee that could not haue bene ouertaken by her faire fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For if there had bene exception taken againſt the beautie of the Goddeſſe of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as did <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi>) no doubt, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Shepheard had yeelded the prize vnto her, and had not needed to haue trauerſed the Seas, to bring away <hi>Heliene,</hi> becauſe ſhe was leſſe faire then ſhee. By her onely, <hi>Zerxis,</hi> had bene able to haue drawne the counterfait of <hi>Iuno</hi> (through which, hee thought to make himſelfe to become admirable and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine) without drawing together ſo manie faire women of <hi>Crotona</hi> as hee did, to borrow from euery one of them ſuch beautie as they had.</p>
               <p>This then, ſo much inflamed my heart, at euery word ſhee ſpake in her daunce, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſwift dart, which thwirled into my ſoule &amp; euery ſtep ſhe moued in the meaſures,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> proued a firebrand to burne my heart withall. Whilſt ſhee (minding her dauncing) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer marked me, nor once ſo much as caſt her ſight vpon mee, except it were by great chaunce. Great perſonages, hauing their mindes buſied about matters of importance, ſeldome or neuer; wouchſafe to looke, or to behold miſerable perſons, which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofitable vnto them.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, <hi>Loue</hi> lying in waite, let not the leaſt of her looks fall vnto the ground, but that with the ſame, he pierced, and through pierced my ſoule, as a young childe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a thouſand pricks vpon a peece of paper, in which hee would ſet out the ſhewe or reſemblance of ſome figure or ſhape.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay? I forgot euery thing, onely to thinke vpon her, and to marke (if peraduenture) ſhe did caſt her eyes vpon me, and (like a foole as I was) I flattered my ſelfe, made my conceit belieue, that ſhe perceiued my meaning, and that ſhe would take ſome pittie of my diſeaſe, conſtruing and interpreting all her geſtures and glaunces, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine owne aduantage: not vnlike that fond Captaine, that dreameth he hath vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his enemies, giuing the ſpoyle away, before he hath wonne the field.</p>
               <p>But, O (how much was I deceiued I when the daunce was ended) ſeeing her,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> where I ſtood, to goe on the other ſide where I ſtood) retiring (as it were) her ſelfe fat from me.</p>
               <p>Yet was I ſo fooliſh for all that, that I thought ſhe vſed this pollicie, to the ende ſhe might bleare the eyes of the reſt, and conceale the great good will ſhee bare me, as if ſhe had had a great care of me, when (as God knoweth) ſhe was far off from the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus Deſire, cauſeth Louers to interprete euerie thing to the beſt, and for their owne conceits, imagining that they cannot loue, but that they muſt needes be loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Phedra,</hi> loued the chaſt <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> yet was not ſhee beloued againe.<note place="margin">An example.</note> 
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Daphne,</hi> yet found no requitall at her handes: and <hi>Myrrha,</hi> doted vppon her owne Father, yet could neuer obtaine, what ſhe ſo much requeſted. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Loue</hi> grewe ſo extreamely within me, as he beganne to make me couragious and bolde, as that Captain which taketh into his grace, his enemie whom he hath ouercom, putteth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15406:72"/>newe life and valour in him. So I would not giue ouer, nor play the coward in this extreame perill: but as a ſecond <hi>Theſeus,</hi> began to deuiſe how I might draw my ſelfe out of this intricate Labyrinth: wherevpon, plucking vp my heart, and ſetting a good face vpon the matter, I aduentured to approach, and to come nigh my faire miſtriſſe.</p>
               <p>O diuine force of <hi>LOVE,</hi> how great his puiſſance is? Being a farre off from her, I was hardie and bolde, I made reckoning that I had gotten her, I deuiſed ſundry ſorts of ſpeeches, which I meant to deliuer vnto her, and began to grow proud in my geſture, wordes, and countenance; But no ſooner came I neere vnto her, but that I was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of man, quite changed and altered, hauing (in ſteed of my former brauados and bragging conceits,) feare and reſpect, awfull dutie, and graue reuerence entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my minde: all which, tooke poſſeſſion of my heart, ſo that I was as timerous as could be, not knowing what to doe.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Caſar</hi> ſtaied a long time, doubting about the paſſage of <hi>Rubicon,</hi> although before he was throughly determined to wade through it.<note place="margin">An Example.</note> I then might haue bene compared vnto that miſerable creature, who calleth for death, prayeth, and moſt earneſtly vrgeth death to come, and to carrie him away. (With a good will faith death, behold me here ready) but when the poore wretch ſeeth him, he is aſtonied, amazed, and terrified, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing rather his roome then his companie. So ſoemed it, that death had feazed vpon me, I being ſo confounded vpon the ſuddaine, that I knewe not whether I had anie hart, life, or ſence, within me or no.</p>
               <p>The Foole perceiueth not his owne follie, which the wiſer ſort take notice of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are wiſe.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> So I, being taken with this new deſire, which had blinded as well (the eyes of my bodie as of my minde) tooke no knowledge of my fooliſh carriage, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being rauiſhed with the faire contemplation of my ſacred Goddeſſe, I neuer thought of any thing, but how to ſtare her ſtill in the ſweete face. O how hard are the entraces in to Loue, where dutious reſpect, timerous feare, vncertaine doubt, and baſhfull ſhame, keepe the doore, through which we cannot paſſe, without their permiſſion and leaue, we being bound to content them all (one after another) before wee can goe any one foote further.</p>
               <p>My beautious Ladie, nothing ſicke at all of my diſeaſe, gaue a geſſe preſently of my maladie, ſhee quickly found out my fault, which I my ſelfe could not ſee, and being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and graue, ſoone deſcried my vaine and idle follie. My cruell paſſions, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded my ſences, (bringing mee to be as an idiot, or as one deuoyd of ſenſe) moued her nothing at all. For vertuous ſhe, had neuer knowne what Loue was, ſhe hauing bene (for her moſt exquiſite beauty, at the firſt beginning of her life) conſecrated and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon that Goddeſſe, whoſe name ſhe bare, and whoſe ſacrifices ſhe moſt ſolemnely did performe. But all Natures are not ſubiect vnto Loue.</p>
               <p>The right <hi>Diamond</hi> can neuer be cut with all the yron tooles that may be, neither can <hi>Cupid</hi> be counted the commaunder ouer all ſuch ſoules as liue heere belowe in the world: whether it is, for that he can doe nothing with vs, except we giue him leaue, and ſo ſubmit our ſelues voluntarily vnto him; or whether it be, becauſe he being blind, and an infant, he canot ſee, how to ſtrike ſuch rightly, which ſcape ſhot-free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tyrannies. She then perceiuing my folly, &amp; acquainted with my ſicknes, began thus to ſchoole me.</p>
               <p>Shepheard, who hath ſo ſuddenly taken away thy voyce and countenance from thee? And what is the matter thou carryeſt thy ſelfe ſo ſtrangely? I am no <hi>Meduſa,</hi> that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth men into ſtones, neither any <hi>Circes,</hi> or <hi>Medea,</hi> to alter the ſhapes of men, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunting potions. Who willed thee to come hither, thus to loſe, both thy ſelfe and thy ſpeech together? what fooliſh imagination hath ſeazed vpon thy ſpirits? what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh diſeaſe doth bridle thy tongue? and what ſenſles dolour doth poſſeſſe all the partes of thy body? Am I ſo ghaſtly a ſight to behold, that my very face maketh ſuch become amazed and aſtoniſhed, and thoſe mute and dumbe of ſpeech, that doe but looke vpon the ſame? What vncoth frenzie hath brought thee hither, to giue vs ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thy extreame and witleſſe follie.</p>
               <p>Fond man, that thou art not ſufficientlie ſatisfied and content, that thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould know of this thy madneſſe, but thou muſt needs make ſtrangers acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſame alſo, who (before) knew no ſuch matter.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:15406:72"/>
               <p>Either withdrawe thy ſelfe from my companie, or elſe declare vnto mee, the cauſe, and the occaſion of this thy comming hither, and of theſe thy brain-ſicke fittes and humours: For what profite or credite ſhould a man looke to get, by talking with ſuch ſortiſh companions, as will belieue nothing but their owne groſſe follie? and who are without reaſon, to take in good part ſuch wholſome admonitions and warnings, as ſhall be for their beſt benefit and behoofe?</p>
               <p>Speake then, or be gone, for a dead truncke of a withered Tree, would performe as much as thou doeſt, thine eyes being onely they (of all thy other members) that ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moue, and ſtrangely ſtare vpon me.</p>
               <p>As the way-faring man, heauy a ſleepe, vnder ſome ſhadowing Oake,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> awaketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſudden, in the morning, when he heareth the Hunts-man, with his yelping dogs, to paſſe along by him; Euen ſo I, with this ſweete voyce of hers, awaked out of my drouſie ſlumber, and contrary to the companions of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> whom the Songs of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> brought to ſleepe, I was much reuiued with the ſame. Or as the watchfull Louer, depriued of his Miſtris, (dreaming in his bed, that hee ſpeaketh vnto her) waketh, and ſtarteth vp ſuddenly, verilie imagining that he ſeeth, and diſcourſeth with her.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, this ſhort and ſharpe Oration of hers, rowſed me (by force, as it were) from my dull and leaden muſings, and brought me into my right wittes againe. O how Loue reſembleth the Sunne! For it taketh away from vs both our voyce and force: As the other giueth life and vigour vnto vs, and by the ſelfe-ſame heate conſumeth vs againe. This made me ſore aſhamed, bluſhing to looke about me. But in the end, I pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp my ſpirits, being bold to anſwere her in theſe tearmes.</p>
               <p>O faireſt, amongſt all that be faire, leſſe perfect then thou art, haue (heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) with their preſence, taken away the ſpeech of more excellent Orators then I am by oddes.

               </p>
               <p>And the ſame Loue, did it not take away all the remembrance from periurde <hi>Iaſon,</hi> as well of the pleaſures, as of the beautie of <hi>Medea?</hi> repudiating her to take <hi>Glauce,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his eſpouſed wife?</p>
               <p>Then (comelieſt Creature of all others created) muſe no more at this my fond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and carriage: and if I haue offended, condemne (not my minde) but thy peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe countenance, which (as the Sunne pierceth the Chriſtall) ſo can it penetrate the power, the puiſſance, force, and might of <hi>Conſtancie</hi> it ſelfe: yea, and through the hardeſt hearte of the moſt barbarous people that are.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt ſpeech I made before her, and which, God knoweth, I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſh, by reaſon I was ſo afraide leſt I ſhould offend her. But this preuailed no more

And now, though too late,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> I repented me, that I had ſpoken any thing.

The louely Virgin, not any thing at all moued in mind, as I was (for though the Fellon that hath offended,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> is troubled before the Iudge, we muſt not therefore ſay, that the Iudge himſelfe being innocent, and the father of the Law, ſhould be aſtoniſht at all:) tooke courage brauely againe, and as it were (in diſdaine) thus began to ieſt at me.</p>
               <p>How now man, what cheare, all amort ſtill? Tell me, thou raſh and vnconſiderate Swaine, doeſt thou not feare the paines of <hi>Ixion,</hi> or to be plagued as that amorous Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was by <hi>Diana,</hi> for his ouermuch ſawcie boldnes? I well perceiue thou findeſt that I am more curteous and gentle, then thou art bolde and ouer-fooliſh-hardie (farre more then any way becommeth thee indeed) thy fault deſeruing as great puniſhment as the others did.</p>
               <p>But it may be, thou art one of that accurſed race of the <hi>Titans,</hi> whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> blaſted with Lightning, for their notorious pride, taking downe their proud glorie, with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible dartes of his all-daunting fierie Thunder.</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou not know, my nature, my calling, &amp; my birth? In going about to mocke me, thou wouldſt ſeeme, to make me belieue that I am otherwiſe then I am: making Loue to be author of thy follie, and my beautie, the mother of thine error. But thou playeſt, as almoſt euery one doeth; For who (euer) hath done a fault, that layeth not the blame thereof, rather on another, then vpon himſelfe? You Louers are happie in one thing, for that you haue this Loue alwayes at command: vpon whome, (as vpon a Rocke) you founde and build all the buildings of your faults, when it is a meere groſſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15406:73"/>Error, to thinke that there is any ſuch <hi>Loue</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>Man, if hee liſt, may keepe himſelfe from Louing: For brideling his appetites, with the ſnaffle of Reaſon, and holding them in their right places, they can no way of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and they no way offending, he can neuer be forced to loue.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note>

               <p>Thou art the firſt that like bold Bayard, durſt be ſo audatious as to trouble me with ſuch ſpeeches as thou, euen now haſt done. For to what purpoſe ſeemeth it the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, to goe about to remoue a huge ſtone or Rocke, from one place to another, whoſe blacke and cold ſhade ſpoyleth his Corne? Or what profite is it for the Pilot, to ſeeke to tarrie the courſe of the flood, becauſe it hindereth his Nauigation? I am vowed vnto the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> and am one of her Virgins, which (onely) I will ſerue.</p>
               <p>Hence then all loue from mee, and thou, that haſt preſumed (as the firſt) to ſpeake vnto me therof, ſhalt be him that ſhalt be firſt refuſed: proteſting vnto thee, that if thou returne againe vnto thine olde Error, I will ſo puniſh thee, as thou ſhalt be a warning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all other whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Ah (good Father) I yet ſtayed for a more hard and cruell anſwere of this angrie Nymph, reſembling the guiltie perſon, who not fearing the arreſt of death, contrarie to his feare, is onely condemned to pay a Fine. Which was the cauſe that hope and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance came vnto me againe: Whilſt with an humble reuerence, I thus began to excuſe my ſelfe vnto her.</p>
               <p>Glorious and reſplendent Lampe, the pureſt Golde in the world, hath ſometimes bene diſpraiſed of men, and counted as baſe, becauſe they knew not the value and worth thereof: Euen ſo, if not any before my ſelfe, haue not attributed glorie vnto thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the reaſon is, becauſe they were not acquainted with the excellencie of the ſame. Say what it beſt pleaſeth youre ſweet ſelfe, yet ſhall you neuer keepe me from worſhipping, admiring, and adoring, that which is ſo precious and rate, as it approcheth neere vnto the Gods; becauſe it is not in the power of man, to hinder the ſame, no more then the bond-ſlaue can contradict whatſoeuer pleaſeth his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>If the diuine Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> hath entertained you for her owne, doe you admire and wonder, that mortall creatures, after the example of the Gods, doe vnto you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence?</p>

               <p>The ſelfe-ſame Goddeſſe which you honour, hath deerely loued a ſimple Swaine, ſhee deſcending downe from the heauens, to come vnto him, and to ſearch for him, with all delightfull and pleaſant ſhewes that may be. <hi>Venus</hi> likewiſe, hath not thought ſcorne of the amitie of louely <hi>Adonis:</hi> why then, ſhould you diſdaine mine?

               <p>Eaſilie may man tame his couetous paſſion, his loſſes, and hinderances, his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and griefes, but hardly or neuer, can hee ouercome Loue.

               <p>If <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> haue loued, therefore thinkeſt thou, that I am bound to follow them, and Loue as they did? If ſo thou thinkeſt, thou art much deceiued.

               <p>Thinke not then, that either theſe thy examples, or theſe thy reaſons, are able to change my minde, to alter my will, or as much as once to make the leaſt breach that is, into the inuincible Forte of my chaſte thought. Subtill <hi>Sophiſters</hi> in their ſchooles, (to maintaine their bad opinions) neuer want Arguments, which carrie the ſhewe and face of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>So you Louers, learne in the <hi>Academie</hi> of your Maiſter, manie goodly diſcourſes, which reſemble ſuch fruite as is faire and ripe outwardly, but within, is rotten and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome, and good for nothing. For how can they be good or iuſt, when the Doctor that teacheth them (by your teſtimonies) is without reaſon, and blinde, and without all equitie and iuſtice? The beginning of your Song is alwayes this, that it would pleaſe vnto entertaine you into our ſeruices: Becauſe (forſooth) your Loue is moſt ſacred and chaſt towards vs. But good wine, in time, groweth to be ſower and ſharpe; And ſo theſe your goodly conſiderations, and chaſt reſpects, waxe daily worſe and worſe, ſo that in the ende, they come to be ſtarke naught indeed, and much diſagreeing with our Honours, as the ſweeteſt meate is ſooneſt ſpoyled, through the heate of the Sunne. Giue ouer then, good Swaine, and neuer talke vnto me more of theſe errors, which make both high and lowe to forget themſelues: otherwiſe, I will ſtoppe mine eares, as the Serpent doeth his, with his taile.</p>
               <p>I ſeeing her choller to be ſomewhat abated, replied thus. Rich Treaſure of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (vnder correction) your owne wordes condemne your owne opinion which you holde; For if wee muſt not iudge by the example of others, and if particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be they good or badde, binde not the generall; Then, why thinke you, that all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are ſcarce chaſte or vertuous? when there be diuers found to be of a contrarie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Nature.</p>
               <p>All the Goddeſſes were not like to <hi>Venus,</hi> nor all the Gods, of the humour of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</hi> He that hath abuſed himſelfe no way, but doeth his buſineſſe honeſtly, and well, (not going about any Treacherie or Treaſon) ought not to abide the puniſhment of a Traitor. For that were to doe againſt all Iuſtice, there being great difference betweene the guiltleſſe and the guiltie, in the manner of their liues.</p>
               <p>When I ſhall haue ſpoken, or done any thing (againſt my former meaning) then may you well enroll mee amongſt the number of thoſe infamous Louers, but vntill I ſhall ſo doe, you cannot iuſtly accuſe mee.</p>
               <p>Did I thinke you were otherwiſe, then you ſay you are, and that Honor, Vertue, Modeſtie, and Chaſtitie, lodged not in your breſt, I could not (I aſſure you) loue you ſo much as I doe: For that Loue that is not immortall, is but a Loue, falſe, deceitfull, and counterfait.</p>

               <p>The Loue which one attributeth alone vnto Beautie, paſſeth and dieth, without the the ſame: but that, which reſpecteth Vertue, continueth ſacred and ſure for euer, becauſe it neuer dyeth, no more then Vertue it ſelfe doth.</p>
               <p>If wee will loue rightlie, then muſt wee loue the ſoule, which is the receptacle of Reaſon, which neuer periſheth, and not the bodie, which in ſmall proceſſe of time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and decaieth.</p>
               <p>My concluſion is thus, that I honour you for your vertue; I loue you, for your beautie; hoping you will accept of my poore ſacrifices, leaſt you be condemned to be more haughtie and high-minded, then the Gods themſelues, who diſdaine not to liſten vnto the ſupplication of a ſincere and loyall heart.</p>
               <p>No more Shepheard (anſwered the Virgin) importune me no more: Hee that is wiſe, ought not (alone) to be without ſpot or blame, but muſt as well be free and cleare from all ſuſpition of the ſame; Taking away the occaſions of vice, to the ende he may not ſinne at all: For he that is graue and conſiderate, can finde no excuſe when he hath offended. For mine owne part, I will neither loue, nor be beloued, much leſſe, be the cauſe of anothers miſerie.</p>
               <p>But O you blinde and frantike Louers, who alwayes make your Miſtreſſes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of all your misfortunes. As if a faire Chriſtall Riuer, and ſuch a one, as is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the whole Common-wealth, ſhould be condemned, for drowning ſuch as caſt themſelues headlong into the ſame, and not their owne fooliſh and deſperate fault.</p>
               <p>But (ſaieſt thou) I cannot hinder thee to loue mee, (a Gods name) let it be ſo, but yet this cold comfort I will giue thee, loue mee as much as thou wilt, yet neuer would I wiſh thee to looke for any requitall at my hands: for if thou doeſt, aſſure thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt be mightily deceiued.</p>
               <p>And take this alſo for a warning from mee beſides, that if thy indiſcretion or want of gouernement, ſhall (by chaunce) bring the leaſt ſpot, or blemiſh vnto mine honor, (yea as much as any ſmall colour of the ſame) I here ſolemnely proteſt, that in reuenging it vpon thee, I will likewiſe puniſh mine owne ſelfe, in that I haue ſuffered thee, ſo farre to runne on, and not to haue plagued thee for thy offence. For I will waſh my hands in my beſt blood, and ſo purge my ſelfe cleare from the fault.</p>
               <p>Fond Shepheard (that thou art) this fraile and withering beautie of the bodie, is nothing worth, in compariſon of that of the minde. And that woman that hath the firſt, and wanteth the ſecond, is like vnto a dead bodie, which is nothing but a faire and fat-feeding for wormes.</p>
               <p>If thou loueſt me indeed, (as thou wouldſt make me belieue) then loue that, which I eſteeme of, more then of mine owne life; that is, mine honour: and louing it, (euen for my Loues ſake, withdraw thy ſelfe from dooing that which may hurt it, and ſo by conſequence, mine owne perſon.</p>
               <p>For, (Shepheard) aſſure thy ſelfe, this mine honour can neuer die, without my life, and they ſailing both in one Boate, neuer ſhall <hi>Diana</hi> ſee the one without the other.</p>
               <p>Admirable Ladie (anſwered I) great wrong doe you offer vnto me, to account me as an enemie, of the thing which you ſo religiouſly eſteeme of in this world. But if I ſo much diſpleaſe you, yet can I eaſily content you againe, in abſenting my ſelfe from you, by a gentle kinde of death.</p>
               <p>Permit me onely to execute the ſame, and then ſhall you ſee, how willing I am to be ſeruiceable vnto you, in all my beſt deuoires.</p>
               <p>If I haue forgotten my ſelfe anie way, I craue pardon for my fault, I beeing ouer raſh, in that I haue preſumed to loue you ſo much as I doe, and not that I euer went about to offer outrage or preiudice, vnto your good Name or Fame, in any ſort what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Or if without making ſatisfaction for mine offence, you will not forgiue me, yet I beſeech you, ſuffer me to die: For neuer will I wiſh to liue, to be holden for an enemie vnto that, which I hold to be ſo precious, and which I eſteeme more off, then of all the wealth in the world.</p>
               <p>Shepheard, Shepheard, anſwered the curteous Damzell, I take little delight or pleaſure in blood. Neither am I deſcended from thoſe Gods, which demaunded men to be ſacrificed vnto them, I will endure all; yet not with force, as Tyrants doe,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15406:75"/>but rather with ſweet mildneſſe, as gentle Princes vſe, I am content thou liueſt, but yet whilſt thou liueſt, I would not haue thee, kill her, who hath giuen thee ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, or to bring her vnto her lateſt home; if by thy fault her chaſte credite be anie way impaired or diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more vnto thee, to content thee? when I haue alreadie (I feare me) ſaid enough, if not too much. I muſt now leaue thee; for I perceiue my Siſter is about to call me, to begin our dauncing againe.

               <p>Hauing ſo ſayd, away ſhe goeth from me, comforting her ſelfe, amongſt her diuine companie: And I, being not a little proud, of this my gentle good fortune, withdrew my ſelfe from the companie, making my prayers vnto the <hi>Muſes,</hi> who deuiſed theſe two Sonnets, which (after the daunce was finiſhed) in the beſt manner I could, I preſented vnto her.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hercules,</hi> though he was valiant, yet did hee loue, and through loue died. <hi>Achillis,</hi> for <hi>Briſſeſſe,</hi> left the defence of his owne Souldiours and countrimen,<note place="margin">An example.</note> &amp; for the affection he bare to <hi>Polixena,</hi> loſt his life. <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> (as the Father and Sonne) walke moſt (commonly together, and fewe generous Cauailiers haue there bene, that haue not vouchſafed to loue. Amongſt the number of which, this youthfull knight was one, who was forced to ſubmit himſelfe vnto the good liking, and to ſeeke the fauour of a faire Gentlewoman (as then attending vpon <hi>Maria</hi> the Queene) and one of her Maidens, of Honour) being the daughter of <hi>Samperius,</hi> an auncient Baron, and defended from a moſt honourable houſe.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:15406:77"/>
               <p>Neither was he much to be diſcommended in ſuffering himſelfe to be ouercome by this young Damozell, he hauing made his choyce ſo well, that for vertue and wit, for ſtature of body, for good colour and complexion, and for perfect properties in all partes of her, there were fewe or none to be preferred before her in all the court of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi> yet, though his fancie was great, he mightily concealed it, vntill (maugre his force) the fire diſcouered it ſelfe, burſting out into a great flame, and that at a very bad time for him, the King then diſpatching him preſently away, for <hi>Saſſin,</hi> to follow the old warres againſt the <hi>Affricans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>Don Horatio</hi> was by nature borne to be a Souldiour, being farre fitter for the field, then to dallie in a field-bed, warre, being his moſt pleaſing paſtime, and that he delighted in nothing ſo much as in battaile, yet did it wonderfully grieue him, to be abſent from his Miſtris, wiſhing in his minde, that he might haue giuen ouer his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and haue ſpun by her ſide (as <hi>Hercules</hi> did ſometimes) rather then to haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her.

               <p>One thing there was, which did not a little grieue him, and that was, becauſe he could not make knowne vnto his Ladie, the ſincere affection he bare her, to the end ſhe might (ſometimes) thinke vpon him, and for feare, leſt in his abſence ſhe ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſome other ſtranger into her ſeruice, he being not able (by reaſon of his quicke diſpatch) to talke with her in priuate, for occaſion offereth her ſelfe (now and than) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as are willing to ſeeke her.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he thought it not amiſſe to write vnto her his minde by Letter, which being done, he knew not how to conuey it vnto her: Much did he ſtudie about the ſame, one while, deuiſing this way, and another while that way, but in the end none pleaſed him at all, he being as farre off to find out any meanes, as when he (firſt) began to thinke thereof.<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> Not vnlike the couetous wretch, who doth nothing elſe night and day, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die how to encreaſe his rich ſubſtance and wealth, beating his braines, onely how to get gold and yet is neuer contented nor ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>But behold how Fortune was <hi>Horatios</hi> friend in his buſines. <hi>Samperius,</hi> the Father of this Gentlewoman, was (by chaunce) as then, in the Indies, two great Caracts, being ſent by him from thence, vnto the King, the verie ſame day, that <hi>Horatio</hi> departed from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to paſſe into <hi>Affrica.</hi> Now our young Louer, whom Loue rouſed vp, as the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth his game, counſelled him, to get ſome of theſe, who were (newly) come to the Court, to deliuer this Letter, as if it had come from her Father, which as he wiſhed, was quickly brought to paſſe.</p>
               <p>For a certaine friend of his, offered him to be the meſſenger, and to deliuer the ſame, with his owne hands vnto her, which he did, ſo orderly, &amp; with ſo great cunning, as none perceiued, no nor the Damozell her ſelfe, but that they were ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her father, vntill ſhe had opened and red them: for there ſhe found the ſweet entreaties of a friend, in ſteed of the graue counſell of a Father: when being deceiued (like him that returning home from a farre country) findeth his houſe (ſeazed vpon by his enemie) ſhe thought to teare the Letters all in peeces, before ſhe had throughly red them.</p>
               <p>But as it is generally ſeene, that nouell ſights, though bad, doe pleaſe our eyes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men of the better ſort, thinking that a ſudden change and alteration of things, will breed their great contentment and eaſe. Euen ſo, this Damozell, moued with this ſtrange caſe (after many doubtfull determinations within her owne ſelfe) firſt readeth one line, and then another, and at the laſt the third, and then foldeth the paper vp, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to reade no more of the ſame, but to burne it. Yet as he, that taſteth good wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (at the firſt) he is reſolued not to drinke much, by little and littile, ſwalloweth downe a great draft, allured by the ſweetnes of the ſame; So this Gentlwoman finding ſomewhat that pleaſed her, in the beginning, made no more adoc, but read them quite out: the copie whereof was this.</p>

                  <hi>Izabella,</hi> (for ſo was her name) not acquainted with the humour of Loue, as ſhe ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted at his amorous paſſion, ſo did ſhe ſcoffe at his Letter, making no account, either of the one, or the other. But as <hi>Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> were giuen by <hi>Augustus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as a ſpoyle vnto his men, at <hi>Arius:</hi> and Souldiers, becauſe they had taken part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, holding with his enemie, the inhabitants thereof being driuen from thence, and hardly entreated) and as ſuch Subiects of that Prince are worſe vſed, and with farre more rigour and crueltie, who proue Rebles vnto him, then thoſe which haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies faithfull and true. Euen ſo, ſuch proud, audatious, and diſdainfull harts, who at (the firſt) make no account of Loue, and refuſe his yoke moſt ſtubbornly, are more fiercely plagued after they are once taken downe and conquered, then thoſe who (betimes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues vnto this ſeruitude, accuſtoming themſelues by little and little, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and beare this bondage patiently; of which, <hi>Sabella</hi> may be a ſufficient witneſſe, as (ere long) you ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horatio</hi> was then forgotten (as the Infant that hath forgotten his leſſon which was taught him) and his Letter torne in peeces, which afterwards the proud Virgin bought at a high rate.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, as two Riuers which mingle themſelues together,<note place="margin">A compariſon.</note> enuiron a whole countrie, and became a little Sea; And as the fire being blowne with two paire of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, kindleth more, then when it hath but one. So <hi>Don Horatio,</hi> pricked forward, by valour and Loue, began to doe incredible matters againſt the Infidels of <hi>Affrica.</hi> So that he became to be famous in euery mans mouth, there being no talke, but onely of his worthie and valiant exployts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Izebella</hi> hearing him to be thus praiſed, &amp; marking how the King himſelfe, with all his chiefe <hi>Martialiſts,</hi> did highly commend him, began by little and little to grow gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and milde. As the hard Diamond, becommeth ſoft (put into the blood of a Goat; and that great Maſſe and lumpe of crueltie of hers, beganne to waxe more kinde, and to breake in ſunder, as the Snow falne thicke vpon the top of a hill, at the ſhining of the Sunne, melteth and droppeth away to nothing, in ſmall time.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:15406:78"/>
               <p>But yet theſe light motions, were not ſufficient, nor ſtrong enough for Loue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he might build a firme foundation: he knowing the preſence, and the ſpeech of the braue Portingall Knight, would doe more good then all theſe, which were no other then caſtles built in the aire, or conceits framed by an idle head, they paſſing away as the clouds do poſte from one to another in the firmament. Not long after, newes was brought vnto the Court (for certaine) that <hi>Horatio</hi> had wonne a notable victorie of the King of <hi>Feſſe,</hi> kild many of his enemies, and gotten a notable rich bootie and ſpoyle: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, was taken priſoner, a maruailous faire Ladie, ſiſter, vnto the <hi>Barbarian</hi> King, married vnto the Lieftenant of that countrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Izabella;</hi> who cared not much, whether ſhe loſt <hi>Horatio,</hi> or no, before theſe newes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe made no great account of him, began now to doubt, that this captiue Dame, would take her conquerour priſoner, robbing her of that, which ſhe refuſed to take for her owne: ſo as now ſhe began to wiſh for to haue him playing as young childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe (who after they haue reſuſed ſome certaine thing) begin to grieue mightily when they ſee the ſame giuen vnto others: and this was the cauſe, ſhe now began to wake and looke about her.</p>
               <p>Diuers ſtrange and prodigious are the effects of Loue, which maketh me thinke, that Force onely, &amp; not <hi>Venus,</hi> was his mother: and that Diſpaire firſt begot him, for he doth nothing but violently: not vnlike vnto the thunder-bolt, which neuer tumbleth downe vpon the ground, but it breaketh one thing or another.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Horatio,</hi> laden with fame, with ſpoyles, and with priſoners, returneth home to <hi>Portingall,</hi> vpon whome euerie one caſteth his eye, whom euerie man doth highly commend, and vnto whome all degrees (whatſoeuer) doe vſe much dutious reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and humble reuerence.</p>
               <p>The King himſelfe doth him great grace, entertaining him with high commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, giuing him many kind thanks, for his ſo valorous &amp; honourable carriage againſt his enemies: yet notwithſtanding all theſe fauours, he rather choſe to haue had one amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous glaunce from his Miſtris, then all theſe Royall curteſies.</p>
               <p>He ſeeth himſelfe honoured by the King, made much of by the Nobles, reſpected by the inferiour ſort, and to be accounted of and commended by euery bodie. Nothing wanteth for the perfection of his glorie. He cannot wiſh for more then he hath, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more, then is alreadie attributed vnto him: yet neuertheleſſe, he maketh no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all theſe his good fortunes, no more then that man doth, who enioy a moſt pretious and ineſtimable Iewell, diſdaineth and refuſeth other little rich ſtones, although they be much valued and accounted of by other. The onely preſence of his Ladie, was that which pleaſed his minde, and the leaſt ſweet looke caſt from her ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, bred more contentment in him, then all the honours and entertainments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Euerie man hath a particular affectection that gouerneth him, and ſome one thing which he eſteemeth more then all the reſt, to enioy which, he accounteth his chiefe glorie, pride and contentment in this world, deſpiſing all whatſoeuer elſe might happen by any other meanes vnto him. Some delight in greedie couetouſnes, ſome in renowmed Chiualrie, ſome in aſpiring ambition, and the moſt part in hote and furious Loue.</p>
               <p>Nothing pleaſeth theſe kind of men, but onely what is affected through theſe things, not eſteeming ought to be good or allowable, which commeth any other way, although it be profitable, praiſe-worthie, and faire. And this was our <hi>Portingall</hi> Knighs conceit, who now was growne into ſuch credit in the court, with the King hauing wonne himſelfe ſuch commendations by reaſon of his valour, as he might commaund that which other Gallants and Gentlemen (ſcarce durſt not open their mouths to entreat for) ſo that hauing egreſſe and regreſſe at all houres, and to euerie place, he one day eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (a fit time) to breake his minde vnto his Miſtris, whom he finding alone, began thus to giue her the onſet: he that is troubled with any griefe, is much lightned of the ſame, when he hath vnfolded and diſcouered it vnto his friend. Now faire Gentlewoman, of all euils that I haue knowne (in my conceit) there is none that commeth nigh vnto Loue, in reſpect of crueltie, for all other diſeaſes haue their remedies onely, he is (as it were) without recure.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:15406:78"/>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, as he entereth in at the eyes, who ſtand him in ſteed of torches, to ſet him a fire in the heart, ſo will he (perforce) paſſe from forth the mouth, taking (the tongue for a Herold) or Trompet of his diſſignes. I ſpeake this by experience, although vnto my no little ſorrow: vnleſſe your harſh and hard rigour growe to be gentle and milde, and except you lay a ſide this cruell vaile which hide the pittie of your inward thought. Alas ſweet (Ladie) if ſometimes we loue thoſe who hate vs, &amp; ſuch as beare vs no good will at all, how much more (in reaſon) then ought we, to affect thoſe that loue vs indeed? For although their friendſhip is not profitable vnto vs, yet neuertheleſſe, ought we to accept of their good wills, inaſmuch, as we cannot loue one, vnleſſe we wiſh, couet and procure the credit and good of ſuch whom we fancie: which me thinkes ſhould binde vs in conſcience, to ſhew the like good meaning againe: conſidering that the bruit beaſtes themſelues, fancie thoſe, that doe good vnto them, doing a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence vnto their gouerners, that gouerne and bring them vp. That your beautie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo rare as it is, cannot ſuffer or indure any thing, that is bad or vitious, I doubt not at all: for (moſt comonly) that which is perfect of it ſelfe, is not ſo eaſily through vice cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, which put me in good hope that you will not blame my loyall amitie, my true intention, nor the chaſt deſire I haue had (alwaies) to ſerue you. If therefore it ſhall pleaſe you, to entertaine me into ſo happie an office, you then ſhall quickly perceiue many true effects, to ſpring forth, from this my faithfull ſeruitude, a double band, tying me, againſt the harſhnes of your rigour, and I being double wiſe moued and compelled to ſerue you; the one is your admirable &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable vertue, which admitteth no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon: and the other is your excellent beautie, which gliſtereth among other faces, as tho Sunne doth among the ſtartes. May be (you will ſay) that Loue hath ſet me downe this leſſon, teaching me what I ſhould ſpeake, and that neuer any Louer thinketh that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect foule which he loueth. To which I will anſwere you, that if you were not worthie of the praiſe I haue giuen you, and meriting euery way, to be beloued, Loue neuer had made vſe of your ſingular perfections, to ouerthrow my libertie, as he hath now done; becauſe he can neuer make a ſhew, of the greatnes of his power, but by ſuch rare Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as Nature doth furniſh him with all, through which he helpeth himſelfe, to take priſoners, the harts of greateſt Monarks: this being the reaſon, we ſeldome or neuer ſees foule or vitious woman to be affected or loued, for that Loue refuſeth to doe ſuch a one as, ſhe any ſeruice at all.</p>
               <p>It is no vnhoneſt deſire, that inflameth me with your kind a mitie, for rather would I chuſe to die, then once to holde within me ſuch a bad thought, and much leſſe, doe I make Eburting mine exerciſe, to paſſe the day withall, now I am free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warres. For too pretious a thing doe I eſteeme Time to be, to conſume and loſe it without any good occaſion: neither is it my meaning any way, to goe about to deceiue you, for ſo doing I ſhould but deceiue my ſelfe; and deceiuing my ſelfe, I ſhould (quickly) be the authour of mine owne proper ouerthrow, my pretence being to ſeeke you with a chaſt minde, in the way of ſacred marriage, with the conſent of your friends, according vnto all orderly proceedings.</p>
               <p>Thinke then (ſweet Lady) how plaine my meaning is, how holy mine intentions are, and how chaſt my deſires; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that Wedlocke is a matter you can hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd: &amp; therefore I beſeech you, if you find me any way worthie of your friendſhip, caſt him not away, that honoureth and adoreth you, more then his owne ſoule: neither fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate him of that good fortune, which he hopeth to find by enioying of your ſeemely ſelfe, becauſe he neitheir will, nor can be fortunate, but to make you bleſſed: neither ſeeke for any renowme, but onely to make your ſelfe, the more glorious for euer. This was the ſumme of the Caualiers ſpeech.</p>

                  <l>Who, ſilent (now) attends his Ladies kind replie,</l>

               </q>
               <p>Our ſaine Maide of Honour, vnaoquainted altogether with ſuch buſines as this, whoſe chaſt cares (vntill now) were alwaies ſhut vnto ſuch Orations as theſe, was much amazed, to heare ſuch a ſpeech as this, not knowing what anſwere to giue vnto <hi>Horatio,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:15406:79"/>vpon the ſoden; She ſaw his vertue, his reputation, and his glorie, had made him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and commendable, his loue to be chaſte and laudable, and his modeſt, and pudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que intentions, worthie of all ſuccour reaſonable.</p>
               <p>But yet on the other ſide, a number of theſe odde contrarie conceits (which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men much in their firſt proceedings, and ſo hardly bring it to paſſe, when they haue begun the ſame, as the moſt part of them, like faint-hearted cowards) giue ouer in their purſuite, without doing any good at all) made her to pauſe, and doubt vpon the matter, fearing leſt, as into vnknowne places, all entrings and beginnings are dangerous, ſo this his eager chaſing in loue, was followed, either for ſome miſchiefe, to light vpon her bodie, or elſe for ſome ſtaine or blemiſh vnto her honour.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch Virgins as are not practiſde at all in the Art of Loue (although they thinke well of ſuch as are ſuters vnto them) alwaies imagine (ſo ſimple are they) that their (credits ſhould be much diſparaged, if they ſhould not giue two or three proud or diſdainfull anſweres vnto their ſeruants, when they firſt begin to court them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for faſhion ſake, this Gentlewoman thought to doe the like: but yet bethinking her ſelfe ſomewhat better of the matter, ſhe thought it was as good to forbeare, as to doe it, one while ſhe thought vpon one thing, and another while, vpon an other, in the end ſhe reſembled
<q>
                     <l>The Roſie bad, which winde bloweth here and there amaine,</l>
                     <l>Holding his head downe, which he raiſeth vp againe.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She loued <hi>Horatio,</hi> admired at his valour, honoured his Chiualrie, highly prized his glorie, and found her ſelfe tickled with the great praiſes he gaue vnto her. But as too much good fortune, is not the beſt, &amp; too much ill fortune, is as bad, the moderate and temperate, being that which is the golden meane; ſo this Damozell compoundeth her anſwere of ſweet and ſower, nouriſhing the minde of her Louer, as well with hope, as with feare; following herein, the cunning Pothicarie, who couereth his bitter Pill with gold all ouer. And thus ſhe anſwered vnto him.</p>
               <p>I willingly confeſſe (noble Lord <hi>Horatio</hi>) that your worthie valour, deſerueth great commendations, but though it be of great force, againſt the enemies of the King, yet bath it no power, nor intereſt ouer me. For although I highly priſe it (as euerie one elſe doth) yet doe I farre more eſteeme of mine honour: and therefore perſwade your ſelfe of this, that in compariſon of that, I ſcorne the greateſt things in the world be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo pretious. I, moſt ſtrange and monſtrous is it, for vertuous Maidens to loue, whoſe liking ought to be tied, vnto the good will of their parents, and depending vpon their pleaſures, they can make no promiſe without their conſents.</p>
               <p>This maketh me to ſmile at you, and to thinke ſuch Louers to want their right wits, that ſo fooliſhly follow in purſuite, the loue of ſuch Virgings as are wholy ſubiect vnto the diſpoſing of their kindred. For what good anſwere may they looke for (to pleaſe themſelues withall) from ſuch as cannot beſtow themſelues as they would? And ſuch an anſwere, muſt I be faine to giue vnto you, for that I cannot aſſure you (for certaintie) of any ſuch thing as you defire. For, of my ſelfe, I am no bodie, but as it were vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert barne, my good ill and my bodie, being wholy in the poſſeſſion, and at the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my gratious Ladie and Miſtris the Queene, and of mine owne Father, my Lord <hi>Samperius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, I ſo well like of a Virgins life, which is not ſubiect vnto cruell Himen, as I wiſh not, nor willingly would giue it ouer, to be come a Bond-ſlaue of a free-woman, not forgetting, that as long as men are woers, they are ſeruants: but no ſooner haue they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what they would, but then (ſtrait) they become Maiſters and Lords ouer vs.</p>
               <p>Againe, I am not ignorant, that they will not ſpare for faire ſpeeches, that they want not pithie perſwaſions, and aboue all, they will not ſticke for golden promiſes. But the old ſaying is, that he that ſcoreth beſt, paieth euer worſt: and great braggers, are leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of their words. And me thinkes you do great iniurie vnto theſe beaue qualities in you, to ſpend your time, in courting a ſillie damozell, who cannot pleaſure you: when you might better employ the ſame, to the great profit of your King and Countrie.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:15406:79"/>
               <p>Then (valiant <hi>Horatio,</hi> follow the Warres againe, and looſe not your glorie and Honor) through vaine and idle <hi>LOVE:</hi> to the ende you may not be blamed, neither I ſuſpected to be the cauſe of your loytering (heere) at home, without doing any thing: as if I had pulled your Armour off, from that warlike, couragious, and valiant bodie of yours.</p>
               <p>And this perſwade your ſelfe, that the renowmed credit which ſhall come vnto you, by your gallant, venturous, and braue exploits, ſhall ſooner winne mee to be yours, then all the cunning traines that you can deuiſe by Loue to take me: and that I make more account and eſtimation of them, then of all the Oathes and proteſtations that you daily vſe.</p>
               <p>And this, when you ſhall haue accompliſhed at the full, and when my Father ſhall be returned from the <hi>Indies,</hi> (if it ſhall ſtand with the good liking of the King, the Queene, and him) I then ſhall be well content and pleaſed, to take vnto husband, ſuch a braue Caualier as yourſelfe is: and vntill then, you ſhall pardon mee. For as I am now, ſo will I keepe my ſelfe, whilſt you (in the meane time) may ſtudie how to ſhewe and make triall, of the rare and admirable proofes of your vndoubted and inuincible courage and vallour.</p>
               <p>But will you then (ſweete Miſtris, replied the Knight) be euery way as good as your word, and performe what you promiſe at this time?</p>
               <p>That will I (anſwered the Ladie) as I am a true Maide. Prouided alwayes, that you take that vertuous courſe, which I haue ſet downe vnto you, accompliſhing euery thing orderly, and all obſtacles and lettes taken quite out of the way, by the conſent of all my foreſaid friendes.</p>
               <p>It is enough (ſaid <hi>Horatio</hi>) and I take your, faire promiſe, vpon which I will build, as vpon a flintie Rocke, aſſuring your ſelfe, that ere long, you ſhall heare ſome newes of mee.</p>

                  <hi>Horatio</hi> making all poſſible haſte to be gone, and prouiding euery thing neceſſarie for his iourney, (preſently) ſaileth vnto <hi>Saffin,</hi> where hee atchieued many ſtraunge and wonderfull enterpriſes, ouer the Infidels in <hi>Affrica:</hi> burning their Cities, ſlaughtering their people, and ouer-running all the whole Countrey: Inſomuch, as his glorie euery day, grew greater and greater, he being now growne a terro vnto his foes, and a great Honor vnto his owne Countreymen.</p>
               <p>Which done, hee commeth backe againe vnto <hi>Portugall,</hi> whither alſo <hi>Sampeius</hi> the Father of <hi>Izabella,</hi> was returned from the <hi>Indies:</hi> who hearing ſuch a generall applauſe of pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Our Louers, ſo entierly louing one another, as they could ſcarcely abide to be one ſmall minute aſunder. So rare and admirable was their loue, as that of <hi>Priam</hi> and <hi>Hecu. ba,</hi> was not the like: Nor that of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cornelia,</hi> to be compared vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>Their two heartes were but one: their two bodies, but one minde and thought: and their will and affection, was all one, without any difference at all.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of their kindneſſe, let that of <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Stratonica</hi> be voyde, and the rare fancie that was found to be betweene <hi>Vliſſes</hi> and his conſtant <hi>Penelope,</hi> there hauing bene (neuer) ſo earneſt, or ardent a kinde of affection, as theirs was.</p>
               <p>But what is too violent, can not be permanent and firme. Tempeſts and ſtormes, the more furious and raging they are, the leſſer time they continue and endure. Euen as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15406:80"/>that bodie is ſuddainely ouerthrowne and killed, that is ſurprized with a moſt ſuddaine dangerous diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Meane while, <hi>Horatio</hi> grewe euerie day in more fauour with his King then other, In ſo much, as not long after, hee choſe him Gouernour of <hi>Anſillies,</hi> whither he muſt needs goe, to keepe poſſeſſion there.</p>
               <p>O how ſweete is Honour, (be it neuer ſo painefull) vnto generous and couragious Spirits, as vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> and to others? They leauing all ſoft, eaſe, and ſafe pleaſures, to runne deſperately to winne Honour: paſſing through many thouſand Pikes, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through infinite dangers and perills, with great labour and paine, before they could attaine vnto the place where it was ſeated.</p>
               <p>So the prudent Prince of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> left his conſtant wife, to follow the long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious tenne yeares ſiege of <hi>Troy.</hi> And ſo the great <hi>Gueſlin,</hi> high Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> left his Spouſe, to venture for that glorie, in the middeſt of wonderfull daungers, which made him famous for euer.<note place="margin">An example.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo our renowmed <hi>Portuguiſe,</hi> although hee held nothing ſo precious, nor ſo religious in the whole world, as he did to liue with his ſweete <hi>Izabella,</hi> whoſe companie was his Paradice, and whoſe preſence, his heauen heere vpon earth.</p>
               <p>Yet would he needes leaue all this felicitie and happineſſe, to endure in ſteelie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the brunts of bloodie Warre, and whole worlds of Trauailes and painfull labours, to the ende hee might winne Honour: which Noble and Heroicall mindes hunt after ſo much. And (which many times, they dearely buy) with the loſſe of their moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liues.</p>
               <p>Hee therefore reſolued to depart, (although not without exceeding great griefe,) to leaue his faire and beautious Spouſe, and the rather, becauſe hee hoped to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more Honour, through his worthy demeanure, and braue carriage, hee hauing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes (as now) to ſhewe afreſh, ſome fruites of his former towardneſſe and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (in his Princes ſeruice in the Warres) by reaſon of that great and worthie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, which was beſtowed vpon him.</p>
               <p>He thought, that (who alwayes) ſhould liue drowned in pleaſures, reſembled the Companions of <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> changed into Swine, and that nothing was well gotten, but what was purchaſte with the hazard of a mans life.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, with manie ſighes, with many bitter teares, and ſorrowfull laments, hee taketh leaue of his dolefull wife. For commonly, we are admoniſhed (by GOD) through ſome ſecret knowledge, when ſome miſchaunce is comming towards vs, which wee can no way auoyde. So that the woefull Ladie <hi>Izabella,</hi> (foreſeeing as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand) the miſchiefe that was like to light vppon her; did nothing elſe, but powre forth whole ſhowres of teares, hauing not the power to let her Husband looſe, from out of her armes.</p>
               <p>The winding Vine, neuer held the Haſell or Filberd, more intangled within her leaues,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> nor the greene Iuy, neuer cleaued (ſo faſt) vnto the olde ſtonie wall, as this young Ladie clung about her heauie Spouſe; whome <hi>LOVE,</hi> whileſt ſought by violence, to hold ſtill, ſterne <hi>HONOVE</hi> plucked him from thence by maine force, carrying him away with him.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Hee was ordainde for further ill, to goe his way,</l>
                  <l>Nor doth the life of Man,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> ſtand alwayes as one ſtay.</l>
               </q>
               <p>His wife prayeth, deſireth; and coniureth him to breake his voyage, to giue ouer his enterpriſe, and to continue ſtill with her: teling him, that ſhee had (as yet) but onely taſted the bleſſed pleaſures which chaſte wedlocke acquainteth faithfull Louers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, without hauing had the lawfull fruition of thoſe ſweete contentments, which ſhe ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>But ſhee pleaded in vaine, and to no ende, her Husband was deafe, and would not yeelde vnto her demaund. <hi>Honour</hi> dryed vp her teares, making them to be of no force, whilſt glorie was the hatchet, that cut off her precious ſpeeches: and deſire of praiſe, the fire which conſumed her moſt paſſionate prayers.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:15406:80"/>
               <p>And therefore (though paſſing loth, hee taketh his leaue and departeth,) carrying away with him the wounded heart of his louely Spouſe, in exchaunge of which, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hauie mournings, and ſadde laments, which followed her, euen vnto her verie graue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horatio</hi> beeing now arriued at <hi>Anſillies,</hi> followeth his buſineſſe moſt fortunately, <hi>Mars</hi> chaſing away <hi>Cupid:</hi> cruell warres, gentle Loue: and hautie ambition, the ſweete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his wife.</p>
               <p>It is a common faſhion of manie men, to follow a thing moſt earneſtly and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and then preſently (and vpon the ſuddaine) when they haue gotten it,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> they giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, nor caring a whit for the ſame any more. Reſembling heerein the way-faring man, who (a far off) ſeeketh a fountaine or ſpring, to ſtaunch his thirſt, and hauing freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his drineſſe, maketh no more account of the water, nor would ſtirre one foote to finde it againe.</p>
               <p>But this was not all. For the Heauens aboue, abounding in good or bad Fortunes, rayne not one downe alone, but many other, all together and at one time: and we ſee (for the moſt part) that one miſchiefe neuer commeth, but that there falleth another, vpon the necke of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For ſo it was, that <hi>Horatio</hi> beeing farre off from his deare Spouſe, and depriued of her company (by reaſon of the warres, wherein he was ſo much buſied) chaunced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come amorous of the faire Priſoner hee had of late taken in a Battaile, as I haue ſaide before: yea, and ſo much doth he doate of her, that as the flaming Torche, darkneth the light of the candle, ſo likewiſe this loue, quenthed the loue hee had before borne vnto his wife.</p>
               <p>O vngodly Husbands, which ſo wickedly falſifie your faiths, vnto your lawfull and louing bedfellowes: deceiuing them ſo ſhamefully, vnto your owne ſhames.<note place="margin">Againſt had Husbands.</note> Haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any of you liued, without being puniſhed of the Almighty, for your hainous faults?

               <p>And did not <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſtaine his hands in the chaſte and pure blood of his owne ſonne <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> for giuing ouer his deare Spouſe <hi>Ariadne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Examples of bad Husbands.</note> to the ende he might ſatifie his luſt with <hi>Phoedra?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo was <hi>Horatio</hi> well plagued for his licentious pleaſures: For God moſt iuſtly puniſhed him, defacing his former glorie, weakning his vertue, ruinating his credit, and vtterly ouerthrowing his vallour.</p>
               <p>So (long ſince) <hi>Salomon,</hi> through Harlots, loſt his diuine wiſedome: they forcing him to become an enemie vnto God. So the ſtrumpet <hi>Dalila,</hi> was the cauſe of the death of <hi>Sampſon</hi> the ſtout. And ſo haue many other braue and great perſonages bene vtterly ouerthrowne, by this inticing Sexe, and ſeuerely chaſtiſed by God, as hee did our great Commaunder of <hi>Anſillies,</hi> who was ſo beſotted of his ſlaue, as hee liued not, but onely by her lookes.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Her eyes, was his bright Sunne, he none deſirde but her,</l>
                  <l>She onely faire was, her aboue (none elſe) he did prefer.</l>
               </q>
               <p>A ſtrange thing, that (many times) theſe fooliſh and wicked <hi>Amours</hi> ſhould be more hot and liuely, then ſuch as be lawfull and chaſſe. The reaſon being, either becauſe they are forbidden by the Law (man commonly, louing that which he is prohibited to doe) or, becauſe they are (as it were ſtolen) or enioy de but ſeldome, keeping ſuch Louers in a perpetuall appetite and deſire. As thoſe who riſe from the table (their bellies halfe filled) come to their dyet with better ſtomack, then ſuch as are ouer-ſatisfied &amp; glutted before. Or elſe, it is (as I thinke) for that the diuell is in theſe leaude liuers, who more and more enticeth and prouoketh them to follow this ſinne, from which they can neuer, (without the great grace of OOD) retire nor withdraw themſelues, vntill ſuch time, as vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction falleth vpon their heads.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15406:81"/>
               <p>But now <hi>Horatio</hi> began to looſe his wonted reputation and credit, euery one ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ill of him, for his new Minion which he had gotten, hee being then, as infamous for his bad life, as he was (before) renowmed for his worthy vertues: yet was he ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ſo impudent, that he would ſtoppe his eares vnto ſuch as ſought to giue him good counſell and aduiſe, making a ſhewe as if he knewe no ſuch matter, and that all was well: whilſt he was ſo bewitched with this raging and inceſtious <hi>Hellena,</hi> as he could not be quiet, nor reſt any where, except this notorious Curtezan were by him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as hee carried her with him into the Warres, whereſoeuer he went, which ſhee made earneſt ſhewe to deſire, faining that ſhe loued him ſo dearely, as ſhe could not liue without his companie: when the truth was, (ſhee ſought all the wayes that might be) to be with her former Husband againe, and to be reuenged of <hi>Horatio,</hi> who kept her ſore againſt her will.</p>
               <p>Such fooliſh women, doing much like vnto Lice or Fleas, which leaue a dead coarſe, (preſently) aſſoone as they finde whereon no more to bite: and ſo theſe kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ware, neuer loue, but for their owne commoditie or profit. No more then the common Queanes, who ſent packing away the prodigall Childe, without as much as one croſſe or pennie in his purſe, to bleſſe him withall.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt our Gouernour of <hi>Anſillses,</hi> liued thus licentiouſlie, the chaſte <hi>Izabella,</hi> chanced to heare how badly her periurde Husband had vſed her, how ill he had demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe toward her, ſhe vnderſtandeth of his follies, and hath knowledge of his ouer-luſtfull and raging fault.</p>
               <p>O how cruell is the wound that one receiueth of his friend! and how grieuouſlie doe we take an iniurie of thoſe, whom we account and holde as chiefe defenders of our wellfare and our good, reputing them as our beſt friends. To receiue a wrong of a foe, is an vſuall matter, but to be abuſed by ones deare friend, doth gall the very heart.</p>
               <p>Too true doth this poore Ladie finde the ſame, who hearing of theſe vnwelcome newes, thought preſently, as gallant ſpirited <hi>Portia,</hi> to giue ouer her life. Diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits ranne in her troubled braine, whilſt ſhee is vexed and tormented with rage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, with griefe and iealouſie.</p>
               <p>One while, ſhe thinketh to die, and then chaunging that aduice, ſhe determineth to reuenge her ſelfe of her vnconſtant Husband, but ſhe bare him ſo loyall an affection, and loued him ſo dearely, that this alſo was quickly out of her minde.</p>
               <p>Now ſhee reſolueth and determineth to commit her ſelfe vnto the mercie of the Seas and windes, and to ſaile, to ſeeke him out at <hi>Anſillies,</hi> to complaine iuſtlie of him there, to reprehend him for his fault, and to be obiect vnto him, in his vicious kinde of life. But diſdaine quicklie altered that deuiſe, thinking with her ſelfe, that in ſo doing, ſhee ſhould too much abaſe her ſelfe, to venture and indaunger her ſelfe ſo much, for a moſt leaude and vile licentious Palliard, hee no way deſeruing ſo charitable an exployt at her hands.</p>
               <p>Manie times did ſhe ſend vnto him, and often did ſhe write, one while ſharply, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while ſweetly, but all was one with him: for neuer would he vouchſafe her any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, by Letter, or by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>Onely hee would Ieſt and gibe at her meſſengers and meſſages, whilſt being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted with the vnhoneſt loue of his enemie, he ſtudied how he might ſatisfie and content her alone; which, his laſt bad vſage, grieued her more then the reſt, enforcing her to beginne to lament afreſh.</p>
               <p>Ah (ſaid ſhe) how iuſtly am I puniſhed for mine owne error. Who will bemoane him, that would not be warned by the harmes of his neighbour?</p>
               <p>What reaſonable excuſe can that man alledge for himſelfe, that falleth into the ſelfe-ſame pit, into which hee hath ſeene him fallen, that hath gone before him? How many wretched Ladies like vnto my ſelfe, (moſt vngodlie abandoned, and caſt off by their wicked Husbands) might I haue had for examples, not to beleeue theſe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men?</p>

               <p>And certainly, were it not for this, I would moſt willingly die, but to the ende, I may ſomwhat vexe, and reuenge my ſelfe of thee, I will, although vnwillingly, liue a little longer; knowing nothing can be more greeuous or vnwelcome vnto thee, then my companie and preſence.

               <p>The foming waues (therefore) ſhall not hinder mee of my iourney: the colde Seas ſhall not freeze the hote deſire I haue to ſee thee: neither the feare of the riſing billowes, ſhall let me from comming vnto thee, I being not able any longer to liue, vnleſſe I may come to put thee in mind of thy fault: not doubting, but the raging waters will be more kinde vnto me then thou art, at (leſt-wiſe) I meane to trie them, by reaſon of the ſmall ioy I haue of my life: which I neither eſteeme, nor make account of at all.</p>
               <p>Thus lamrnted this comfortleſſe Ladie, whome Loue and Iealouſie egged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to goe onwards with her iourney.</p>

               <p>But (now) by this time, the deſolate Ladie, had cauſed a Shippe to be throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at all points, into which, as a couragious <hi>Medea,</hi> ſhe entreth, cutting and ſlicing the ſalt waters, ſo long, till at laſt, ſhe happily arriueth at that Citie, vnto which her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had with-drawne himſelfe, the better, and more ſafely to liue, in his ſecure and ſenſuall pleaſure.</p>

               <p>Ah God, ah God, was it not enough, that I had mine husband to my mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but that I muſt (needs) haue the waues of the Sea alſo to bandie againſt me? for what remaineth to come, or what can there be left behinde, to make me more miſerable and vnfortunate then I am alreadie? ſeeing that he, who hath promiſed me ſo great loue, ſo great friendſhip, and affection, and vowed ſo much, and ſo many oathes vnto mee, is the onely man, that perſecuteth me, as if I were the deadlieſt foe that he hath vpon the face of the earth?</p>
               <p>Ah hard harted, and forgetfull Knight, ill wouldſt thou paſſe ſo many dangers, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through ſo many perills, and hardly wouldeſt thou endure ſuch a hell of diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for the loue of thy wife, as <hi>Vliſſes</hi> did for his, ſeeing, when I come vnto thee, with ſo great trouble, thou not onely diſdaineſt me, but alſo refuſeſt to admit mee to come into thy preſence.</p>

Such as are guiltie, and doe (but worthily) ſuffer for the euils they haue done, complaine (vniuſtly) and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, but oh how hard and vnſupportable griefe is it, to reape iniuries, in ſteed of reward, for doing good turnes? and how bitter is the paine which we endure, through the malice of thoſe, whome wee loue beſt, and of whom we expect the like friendſhip againe?</p>
               <p>The offence we receiue of our enemie, is tollerable, becauſe the law permitteth reuenge in that caſe, whereas the law of friendſhip, forbiddeth to reuenge vs on ſuch whom we affect, for feare of their diſpleaſures.</p>
               <p>Ah my good God, what fault haue I committed againſt my husband, that he ſhould vſe mee thus deſpitefully: Haue I as <hi>Clitemnestra,</hi> defiled our Nuptiall bed?

Oh no, I feare no ſuch matter; God that ſeeth the ſectets of all hearts, knoweth my conſcience is free of any ſuch ill.</p>
               <p>What haue I then done? Alas I know not. Alas, for what ſinne am I thus ſeuerely puniſhed?

               <p>Ah gentle death; if euer the wailings and lamentings of a moſt diſtreſſed wretch, haue euer moued thee to compaſſion and pittie, ah then let me obtaine the ſame at thy hands.

Or that my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull heart (wearie with ouermuch ſighing and ſobbing) would breake, and burſt in peeces.

Degenerate knight, and voyd of all remorſe, ſeeing thou meaneſt to entertaine all kind of cruelties whatſoeuer, that haue bene found in any creature (yea cuen worſe, then the bruite beaſts themſelues doe vſe) why doeſt thou not put in practiſe, the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die execution of the ſame, by cutting in twaine my throat, as thou haſt moſt irreligious cut in ſunder the ſacred band of Marriage, which ſhould haue bound vs (ſtill) faſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

               <p>And this was the cauſe that our <hi>Portuguiſe,</hi> ſo inſolent (before) began now to yeeld and to be vanquiſht, remembring himſelfe of his fault, and reſoluing from his heart, to amend the ſame (had it not bene for his ſtrumpet) who very cunningly perſwaded and egged him forwards of his iourney) he had (as then) returned backe with his wife vnto the Citie againe, to entertaine her according vnto her deſert and calling: this had he done, had it not bene (as I ſay) for the other, whom (now) in minde, he began to loath and hate (the preſence of his owne Spouſe, making the other ſeeme in his eyes, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and foule, as well in body, as in minde) and but for that he could not with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour retire backe) being gone ſo farre on his way, leſt the world ſhould haue thought he durſt not dare to looke his enemie in the face.</p>

               <p>Meane time, the <hi>Portingales</hi> gathered themſelues againe into battaile array, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their enemies, with ſo hote a purſuite, as they (at the laſt) recouered, and brought backe againe the bodie of their Capitaine, ouer which, the Moores meant to haue trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed.</p>

But ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull newes were theſe vnto heauy <hi>Izabella,</hi> who hoped, that at the ioyfull returne of her husband, all ſhould be well, as ſhee her ſelfe could wiſh. But man purpoſeth, and

               <p>So <hi>Senacherib,</hi> thinking to conquer, was (himſelfe) conquered: and the Iewes, who thought themſelues to be quite ouerthrowne, came in the end to be victors. So proud <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlaine contratie vnto his owne conceit, and to the opinion of all men.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Amon</hi> was hanged, neuer any thinking he ſhould haue died ſuch a ſhamefull death. And <hi>Mardocheus,</hi> who was condemned (to be ſlaine) was honoured &amp; deliuered. And ſo it fell out with this vncomfortable Ladie, who hoping to ſee her husband to come home well, and ſafe vnto her (and to repent him of his former follies) found him to be ſlaughtered and dead, without life or ſoule.</p>
               <p>O cruell mutation &amp; change, truth it is, that ſhe (before) had heard by certaine of her husbands Souldiours that had eſcaped out of the field, that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> had loſt the day, but (yet) knew ſhe nothing of his death. And yet euen then, a cold feare ran all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her heart, whileſt ſhe (ſore ſuſpecting the worſt) propheſied within her ſelfe, that it was true, and that ſhe had loſt her husband: and (not not long after) her doubt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but with too too true a proofe, when the reſt of his band, brought his coarſe into the citie, vnto her, where ſhe was, and when (ſo denly) at the ſight thereof, ſhe ſounded, it being long before they could get life in her againe: whileſt (in the meane ſpace) <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tios</hi> mangled carkaſſe was laid in a bed, God giuing him ſo much time of repentance, as he craued mercie of him, and of all the world for his bad life, whileſt all that ſmall time as he (ſo) lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted his ſinnes, his faithfull Souldiours, with ſad teares, wonderfully lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the loſſe of ſo noble a Generall, vnder whom they had alwaies remained vanquiſhers.</p>

               <p>Great <hi>Machabeus,</hi> one of the Nine WORTHIES, was neuer more lamented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his men of warre, than he was amongſt the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> whom he had ſo often brought home victorious &amp; lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with forraigne ſpoyles into their countrie; Who then perceiuing himſelfe, to drawe nigh vnto his end, deſired to talke with his wife, that he might take his lateſt leaue of her.</p>
               <p>But now what is he, that can lend mea Sea of Inke, to ſet downe the grieuous paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the inſupportable ſorrowes, of his pittifull wife? Where ſhall I find a pen of Iron, to paint forth her lamentable ſpeeches? And what paper is ſufficient to receiue in writing, the number of her more, then ſad and heauie complaints?</p>
               <p>To hers, was the woes of <hi>Niobe,</hi> nothing at all. Nothing the griefes of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thoſe of <hi>Portia,</hi> nor thoſe of chaſt <hi>Lucretia,</hi> compared vnto hers. With much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, was ſhe brought vnto the bed (for goe ſhe could not, for very faintnes &amp; weakenes) where her repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant husband was giuing vp the Ghoſt) who ſo ſoone as he beheld her, O griefe, O loue, O pittie, &amp; O heauie ſpectacle that it was, to ſee this heauie meeting, ſuch (as like) was neuer ſeene before: the poore dying ſoule, beginning in his death, to affect and loue her more entirely, then euer he had hated her before, whileſt thruſting forth his dying armes with ſeeble force, to embrace her, and laying his cold lips vpon hers, with a hollow faultring voyce, he began (thus) to ſpeake as well as he could.</p>
               <p>O fortunate day, in which poore <hi>Horatio</hi> dieth, repoſing himſelfe at eaſe in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his <hi>Izabella.</hi> O my chaſte and ſweet Ladie, muſt I needs die, leauing after my death ſo foule a fault, as thou ſhalt haue cauſe to complaine of me, as the authour of all thy griefes whatſoeuer. No way am I able to make thee any reaſonable ſatisfaction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know I, how ſufficiently to make amends for ſo hainous, and ſo deteſtable an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as I haue committed againſt thee, which the iuſt God hath reuenged vpon me for thy ſake, and according as I deſerued.</p>
               <p>But (ſweet wife) if (as yet) there remaineth any one ſmall ſparke, of that rare and loyall Loue, thou haſt heretofore borne me, and if iuſt griefe, and rightfull diſdaine, hath not quenched it all, and quite put it out; then by the ſelfeſame affection and fancie, I pray, deſire, and beſeech thee, moſt humbly to pardon me this once, and not to be the cauſe that miſerable <hi>Horatio,</hi> ſhould goe into his graue with great anguiſh, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15406:85"/>bitternes of his ſoule. This pardon, as I hope for of thee, ſo doe I expect it at thy hands: crauing in the meane while (by reaſon of that litle ſpace of time I haue to breath) thou wilt doe me the fauour to embrace me kindly, if it ſhall pleaſe thee, to thinke me worthie of ſuch a kindnes: this being the laſt requeſt, and lateſt fauour I ſhall craue at thy hands.</p>
               <p>Ah let me kiſſe thoſe faire cheekes which were (ſometimes) mine, and thoſe ſweet ſparkling eyes, which had not the blacke foulnes of my fault dimmed them, they had ſtill ſtood me in ſteed of two glorious Sunnie lights. Although I cannot denie, but thus to die in thy armes, doth much lighten and eaſe me of my torments I endure within my minde, yet had it pleaſed God, to haue but giuen me the grace, to haue ſuruiued (but ſome fewe yeares) that I might haue made ſome amends vnto my faithfull Spouſe (whom I haue ſo wickedly abuſed) I then would haue thought my ſelfe, to haue bene the happieſt creature vnder the heauens. Thinke (deare heart) that I make no account, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care any thing at all to die, but onely for this cauſe, and for that I ſhall be forced to leaue thee a Widow, whom I loue, more then my owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>Iuſt and great reaſon haſt thou to complaine and find fault with me, and farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie am I, that thou ſhouldeſt ſhed theſe ſalt teares for my ſake. For why ſhouldeſt thou waile his death, who hath bene thy chiefe aduerſarie? why doeſt thou ſorrow for the loſſe of thy mortall enemie, and lamenteſt thou the death of him, who ſought thy vtter ouerthrow? Drie vp theſe teares, for I deſire them not. Leaue theſe thy ſighes, for I not merit them: and giue ouer theſe thy bitter wailings, for I am no way worthie of them. Onely pardon me, &amp; cloſe vp theſe my dying eyes, when they ſhall lèaue their wonted light: which done, if it ſhall pleaſe thee to honour this miſerable carkaſſe of mine, with thy preſence, vnto my Tombe, and (now and then) to thinke on me (although thou haſt ſmall reaſon ſo to doe) then, then I ſay, ſhall I be euery way contented and ſatisfied vnto the full. Weepe not I pray thee, then for me, who deſcrues no teares at thy hands, but rather ill thoughts: for otherwiſe I ſhall ſuſtaine a double death, thy ſorrow being nigher ſetled vnto my heart, then my deperture hence can be any way dolefull vnto me.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, the fainting knight kiſſeth his wife, wiping her blubbered eyes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her (as ſtraitly) as the Iuie doth the wall. If the poore Ladie could not anſwere him, it was no great wonder, when as thoſe that were but ſpectators in this heauie ſight, (although they felt not as much as ſhe) yet were they moueleſſe, and much amazed for verie pure pittie.</p>
               <p>In the end, the diſconſolate <hi>Izabella,</hi> began to recouer her ſpeech, anſwering him in this ſort. Cruell and hard-harted husband, let my pittifull paine, my eaſeleſſe griefes, and my inſupportable ſorrowes, ſatisfie thee, without gaulling me any further with this word (pardon) vnto her who neuer deſired to liue, but to doe thee ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Ah deare <hi>Horatio,</hi> thinkeſt thou I can liue after thy departure hence, and that I can ioy in this world, being bereaued of thy companie? Whileſt thou did deſt liue, I was thine by the lawes of marriage: and when thou art dead, I will be thine alſo, reſolued to follow thee, whereſoeuer thou goeſt, thinking my ſelfe happie, that I am ſo luckily come, as to die with thee.</p>
               <p>Then, if I may, or thou wouldeſt haue me to giue any credit vnto thy ſpeeches, then in requitall of them all, let me againe intreate thee this one thing, which is, that I may leaue this world with thee. But why ſhould I aske leaue of thee, when I am at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie my ſelfe, to diſpoſe of my life, as I ſhall thinke good of: and when with ending of one life, I may rid my ſelfe of a lingring death, which doth continually haunt me? Thankes (therefore) to thee kind <hi>Thethis,</hi> who didſt driue my ſhippe into this Port, where I may paſſe to heauen with him, who was the onely life, and maintainer of my life, and who (being dead) I can no longer remaine allue.</p>
               <p>Pittileſſe husband, to debarre me from my teares, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I ſee my countrie depriued of a braue defender of his libertie, and find my ſelfe forſaken, of the onely, loyall, and moſt louing friend I had here vpon this earth. No, no, I will weepe, and ſhed teares, as long as any drop of moyſture ſhall remaine within this bodie: for ſhould I not waile for thee, for whom (then) ſhould I reſerue theſe teares? Whoſe loſſe ſhould I lament but thine? and for whom ſhould I take thought or care for, but for thine owne ſweet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15406:85"/>ſelfe? who was ſo neare to mee as thou? who ſo deare as thy ſelfe? and who is to haue intereſt in mee, but my beſt and ſweeteſt <hi>Horatio?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then hinder not her from lamenting, who liueth onely to ſhead teares: and doe not enure the happines ſhe findeth, in that ſhe hath time to bewaile her vnhappie Fortunes. How wide is (my beſt Lord) from mine intention and meaning? and how ſlenderly doth he conceit of my loue towards him? when hee imagineth, that although I ſee him dye, yet ſhould not I waile: and that his death and deſtruction, ſhould not be the ende and date of my life: this beeing the leaſt thing that I can doe for him, the leaſt dutie that I doe owe vnto him, and the ſmalleſt teſtimony of my great affection, which I haue euer borne him.</p>
               <p>Guſh forth then my briniſh teares, and ſtreame downe along my pale cheekes, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing away the bloud of my wounded Spouſe, mingling your ſelues together, as my ſoule hath alwayes bene (with his) moſt perfectly mixed and conioyned, the one with the other. (My deareſt Lord) if euer thou haſt thought well of mee, ſpeake neuer more of this word pardon, it becommeth me to intreate, rather then you: I hauing bene ſhee, that hath ſo often offended you: let vs forgiue &amp; forget all vnkindneſſes whatſoeuer, that our ſoules as moſt loyall friends, may die and liue together in eternall felicitie for euer.</p>
               <p>O how like an Angell (replyed <hi>Horatio</hi>) doth my <hi>Izabella</hi> ſpeake, and how pleaſing doth ſhee cauſe my death to be vnto mee? would ſhe but promiſe to ſuruiue and liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death. (For ſweet Lady) it is thy ſorrows, and not my death, that ſhortens my lifes and I die not for griefe, but for ſorrow, to ſee thee lament for my cauſe. Wilt thou die, and doeſt not deſcrue death? No, it is I that haue offended, and therfore merit to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for my fault.</p>
               <p>Liue thou happilie ſtill, and ſafely returne thou home into thy Countrey againe, where thou ſhalt not want new husbands, who will deſerue (at thy handes) far better then I haue done: &amp; had I not ſo much forgot my ſelfe towards thee, as (I confeſſe I haue) my ioyes had bene at the higheſt, and I had departed hence, the happieſt man aliue. But now mine houre approcheth; I feele death ready to arreſt mee with his yron mace; my heart fainteth, and my ſoule beginneth to flie from hence.</p>
               <p>To you I turne my ſpeech now (my faithfull fellows, and companions in Arms) who haue always taken ſuch fortunes as I haue done; to you I recommend the honor of your deare friend <hi>Horatio,</hi> (ſomtimes your Gouernor) after his death. Moſt ſtrictly charging you (as you ſhall anſwere before God) and moſt kindlie intreating you, (as you will haue the good will of men) to ſee my faithfull and conſtant wife, conueyed ſafely from hence into <hi>Portugall,</hi> according vnto her calling (after this my carkaſſe ſhall be interred) &amp; there to doe her all dutifull ſeruice that may be.</p>
               <p>Farewell my brethren, my friendes, and my companions: I goe before you, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare places for you. I goe to heauen, there to enioy eternall happineſſe. Giue me your hands euery one of you before I die, and leaue now theſe your needleſſe and vnneceſſary mournings in my behalfe. Remember that God is iuſt in all his actions, who hath (and that deſeruedly) puniſhed mee, for abuſing my conſtant Spouſe, ſo hainouſlie as I haue done, being ſo voyde of grace, as to preferre a moſt damned ſtrumpet, before her chaſt and vertuous ſelfe, which was the onely occaſion of mine vntimely death.</p>
               <p>Murmure not therefore at the diuine iudgements of the Almightie, neither be you grieued at my loſſe and ouethrow: for a far better, and a brauer Captaine may you haue then I am, <hi>Portugall</hi> being able to veeld forth men, better for deſert, and for valour then I haue bene euery way. I ſay no more, but wiſh you (my faithfull Souldiers) no worſe, then I doe vnto mine owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>And now once more againe I come to thee (my chaſteſt wife.) Although, what to ſay, more (then alreadie I haue done) well I knowe not: Loth I am to leaue thee, yet leaue thee I muſt, and therefore I hope thou wilt remember, not the fault I haue done thee, but, how I repent me for the ſame before I die. And this perſwade thy ſelfe, that if euer ſinne hath bene grieuous vnto the ſinner, then hath mine bene the ſame: My verie ſoule beeing ſore vexed and tormented, day and night, euery houre that I doe but thinke thereof. But things paſt and done, are not to be vndone: and what is once remedileſſe, muſt needs prooue to be recureleſſe.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:15406:86"/>
               <p>Once more farewell, my ſweete <hi>Izabella,</hi> to whom I wiſh no leſſe ioy, then I haue felt of ſorrow. Thou God, that knoweſt the ſecrets of all hearts, receiue my ſoule (I beſeech thee) and ſaue it from the hands of the enemie. So ſaying, hee gaue vp the ghoſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infolded within the chaſte armes of his kinde wife, his face touching her face, and his lippes ioyning vnto hers.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was his carkaſſe without life, and colde as a marble ſtone, but his meſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Izabella</hi> ſunke downe for ſorrow. So that afreſh as then, began cryings out, ſcree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, wringing of hands, and ſheading of teares, the houſe reſembling a ſhadow of that miſerable mourning, when the <hi>Troyans</hi> ſaw their Citie ſet on fire by the <hi>Grecians</hi> in the night. So wofull and ſo ſhrill was the ſorrowes that euery one made for their Lord, as the noiſe therof, waked their vnfortunate Lady from her paſſionate extaſie, who being ſomwehat come vnto her ſelfe, and falling vpon the dead coarſe, began thus to exclaime.</p>
               <p>Woe is me, that euer I was borne, and art thou dead, my deare Lord without mee? Ah why haſt thou left her, who had rather die with thee, then liue with anie other elſe. Thou haſt left me at the worſt, now thou art gone. For what am I, but an Anatomie of griefe it ſelfe? What is my heart but a receptacle of ſadneſſe? And what are mine eyes, but a colde fountaine, that diſtilleth ſalt water continually?</p>
               <p>Is it likely or poſſible, that <hi>Izabella</hi> ſhould breath, now <hi>Horatio</hi> is breathles? Can it be he ſhould be dead, and I ſhould be as yet aliue? No, no, it cannot be, and yet in the meane time, his bodie is without life, and ſenſes, and mine, too full of vitall motion: but long it ſhall not be ſo; I muſt now reſolue my ſelfe to follow the courſe my husband led mee, and to take ſuch part with him, as he hath taken before me: vnfortunate I, to haue ſtayed ſo long, and that I died not before my louely husband. Could <hi>Portia</hi> die, when <hi>Brutus</hi> was ſlaine? and may <hi>Izabella</hi> liue, her <hi>Horatio</hi> hauing left her? Before that time come, the Seas ſhall chaunge the courſe of his floods, and mountaines ſhall remoue, and come to ſettle amongſt lowe valleyes. As I ſaw thee (here) vpon the earth, ſo hope I to behold thee in the Heauens. And for the concluſion and ende of all my diſaſters, I will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in the place where thou art buryed. Then kiſſing the pale lippes of her dead huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhee thus began againe.</p>
               <p>O faire mouth, from whence ſometimes I ſucked <hi>Nectar</hi> foorth, muſt thou be a Trophee for death? And muſt thou be deſpoyled of ſo many rich vertues, to make fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous his victorie? Sweete louely eyes, muſt you likewiſe ſerue to honour death, reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer your <hi>quondam</hi> Diamond lights, vnto blacke and gloomic darknes? And thou beautious face, muſt thou turne vnto earth, and ſhewe pale and wanne, whilſt I remaine here againſt my will and pleaſure?</p>
               <p>No reaſon is there herein, but that I ſhould follow my Guide, and accompany him, at whoſe commaund I was alwayes, and that moſt willingly. Ah my kind friends, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure you, by the late affection you bare vnto your Lord and Goueruor (now dead) by the faith and promiſe you vowed and ſware vnto him, and by the ſacred remembrance of his glorious renowne, which neuer ſhalbe forgotten, that you conſent and agree to bury our two bodies both in one graue. Whilſt I liued, I eſteemed as my chiefeſt treaſure, my honor &amp; good name; and now I die, my loue vnto my Lord ſhall remaine as a preſident for Ages to come, of our loyall and true faithfull loue.</p>
               <p>I come ſweet <hi>Horatio,</hi> I come, nor will I any longer linger in miſerie, but will ſeeke thee whereſoeuer thou art, vntill I finde thee, ending this my loathed life, with a death moſt ſweet &amp; comfortable. Then (ſweet <hi>Ieſus</hi>) be mercifull vnto me, and forgiue me this my laſt fault: which extreame and vnſupportable ſorrow, and not any deſperate kinde of conceit, forceth me to put in practiſe. And hauing ſo ſaid, ſhee went about to ſtabbe her ſelfe with a poniard vnto the hart; when one of the company there by, ſnatcht it forth of her hands, vppon the ſuddaine: wherevpon, ſhee ſeeing her ſelfe to be preuented of her purpoſe, looking angerly vpon them.</p>
               <p>Well, quoth ſhe, <hi>Portia</hi> (for all her Gard that watched ouer her) had her will, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Cato</hi> (deſpite of all his attendants) ſlew himſelfe. And thinke you for all your nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row looking vnto me, that I will not rid my ſelfe one way or another of life? Yes, yes, ye vnkind men, I will diſpatch my ſelfe from this miſerie (mauger your malicious minds) who I perceiue do enuie at my good Fortune: and I will complaine of your hard dealing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15406:86"/>towards me vnto my deare husband, in that you go about to keep me from him, whither I will or no. Nor was ſhe deceiued of her purpoſe, though thriſe happie, in that it pleaſed God to call her himſelfe, from out this vale of miſerie, and ſo by that meanes to ſaue her ſoule. For no ſooner was ſhee hindered of her intent, but what for anger thereof, and what for extreame griefe, for <hi>Horatios</hi> death, ſhe fell into a dangerous and hote burning Feuer, which ſo violently ſeazed vpon euery part of her, as her weake bodie being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure the fierie raging thereof, ſhee yeelded her tormented carkas vnto death, within ſixe dayes after. At what time ſhee was freed from all her former troubles, and after her death, ſhe was (according vnto her deſire) enterred with her husband, leauing behinde her many commendations, for her matchleſſe vertues, her loſſe being lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of cuerie good bodie, as was fufficiently ſhowne, by the pittifull laments that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where vſed for her ſake, becauſe of the rare examples of chaſtitie, of patience, of modeſt demeanure, of loue, and of loy altie, which ſhe carryed towards her vngratefull and vnkind Husband.</p>
               <p>And this (Shepheard) is the hiſtorie I meant to report vnto thee, but becauſe that <hi>Diana</hi> looking paliſh with her ſiluer hornes, meaneth to runne her courſe, entering into the place of her gliſtering brother the Sunne, wee will (for this time) vntill to morrow morning, withdraw our ſelues vnto our Cortages, and then, as earlie as thou wilt, ſhalt thou begin the diſcourſe of thy Loue againe.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, the olde man, and <hi>Arcas,</hi> began to retire themſelues homewards, and by the way they encountered a faire Shepheardeſſe, who propoſed a Riddle vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſiring him to interpret the ſame rightly. And this was it that followeth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For others good and profit, I (outragious) ſtill</l>
                  <l>Conſume, what doth my proper vigor entertaine:</l>
                  <l>And though my burning is not (vnto anie) ill,</l>
                  <l>Where I ſhould praiſ de be, they vngras of all me doe name.</l>
                  <l>Father of liuing Creatures all, I am renoumde,</l>
                  <l>And Lord I am ouer the Time, on earth, that ſtaies:</l>
                  <l>Yet doth a little thing dant mee, and me confound,</l>
                  <l>And of a Conquerour, conquered, forceth mee ſtrait-waies.</l>
                  <l>But in the end, although that I am plagued thus,</l>
                  <l>Through ſuccour of the windes, when (all) thinke I am dead,</l>
                  <l>I riſe againe, to men (of times) most dangerous,</l>
                  <l>And through my harmefull rage, I fill them full of dread.</l>

                  <l>(For ill) I good doe to my ſpightfull enemies:</l>
                  <l>Iudge then, ſince Serpents in my boſome, I doe cheriſh,</l>
                  <l>If I ore wretched am not, in most pittious wiſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The other Shepheard knew not the meaning of this Riddle, which the old man inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in this ſort. Your <hi>Emgma,</hi> (faire Shepherdeſſe) ſignifieth the fire, which being for the vſe of man, to warme him, conſumeth &amp; deuoureth the wood, it being his mother, and nouriſher. It is counted the Father of all liuing Creatures, who without heat, cannot liue. Although he is of great force, yet doth a very ſmall thing vanquiſh him, which is water. Neuertheleſſe, when he ſheweth to be dead, a little blaſt of winde maketh him to burne more furious then before. He doth good to ſuch as count and call him vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in warming them with his heate, and deuoureth his mother, which is the reaſon he tearmeth himſelfe to be moſt miſerable and wretched.</p>
               <p>This ſolution euery one commended, when (as they were walking homewards) one of the Shepheards ſung this <hi>Ode</hi> following.</p>

               <p>Too true (noble <hi>Phillistell</hi>) doeſt thou know this to be, thou being ſo farre off from thy faire and ſacred <hi>Iulietta</hi> and yet neuertheleſſe, thou liueſt in her, and ſtill dreameſt of her beautie, whileſt louing her, (although ſhe be abſent) thou canſt not forget her, for that ſhe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy heart with her as in a cloſe priſon, thou (in the meane time) feeling, and by thine owne experience fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how cruell vnto a loyall Louer, the abſence of his beautious Ladie is: the fiſh, not more deſiring to haue water for his nouriſhment, then he doth couet her companie, it being the chiefe foode of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>O how tedious and irkeſome vnto him (who attendeth and expecteth the breake of day to come, hauing ſome great matter of importance to diſpatch) is the long ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming courſe of the vnwelcome night: In all which time, he is not able to take any reſt, looking ſtill with open eyes, to ſpie the riſing of the faire Sunne, which he ioyfully mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, at his firſt appearing, to warme the little hills, to melt the ſoft ſnow, to gliſter and ſhine vpon the earth, and with a ſolemne pace, to mount vp, and to ſettle himſelfe in his glorious chariot, riding in progreſſe through the huge giring Vault of heauen, he ſeeth him brauely to chaſe away the ſparkling Starres, as the Conquerour doth his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he hath vanquiſht; and beholdeth the ſad and ſable night, to flie from his cheerfull face, as the timerous thiefe doth the ſeuere Iudges preſence, whileſt he liſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto the melodie of thouſands of pretie Birds, which ſolemnize and celebrate, in their warbling notes, the arriuall of the prudent Sire of proud <hi>Phaeton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poore <hi>Philistell,</hi> how often haſt thou counted ſhort daies for long yeares, after that malitious Fortune had ſequeſtred thee, from the companie of thy Ladie? and how many times, didſt thou dreame in the night, that thou ſaweſt her, deuiſing and talking with thee, in the ſame manner as ſhe was wont to doe, when thoſe happie Deſarts of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> were true witneſſes of thy chaſte Loues? But all theſe were but fond imaginations, thy deſire being but vaine, and bootleſſe, which ſo much the more vrged thy ſoule to ſee her againe, becauſe her onely ſight, had (long ſince) wounded thy deareſt libertie. Too true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly didſt thou then proue, that the greateſt griefe which the Louer endureth (being by his ſweet Loue) is nothing in compariſon of that which her abſence bringeth vnto him, for ſhe (which wounded him) is (then) at hand, and preſently might helpe him if ſhe pleaſe; whereas contrariwiſe, O'how leane, and meger, is the hope of him that is hurt, and is farre off from a Chirurgian to heale him. Small wounds are vncurable, where none is to helpe them, and the moſt deſperate diſeaſe may be remedied, if a cunning Doctor be in a readines to heale the ſame.</p>
               <p>If at any time a Louer (not hauing tried, how bitter the abſence of his froward dame is) deſireth to be baniſhed farre from her, by reaſon he is not able to ſupport and indure her too too rigorous and diſdainfull demeaners towards him; how often then will he (afterward) condemne, and curſe this his raſh and haſtie opinion, when (being farre from her ſight) he mourneth, and bewaileth in the verie anguiſh of his ſoule, her abſence,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15406:88"/>which hee ſo much (although in vaine) doth wiſh for.</p>
               <p>If wearie Trauellers reioyce, when being nigh vnto their natiue ſoyle, they ſee their chimneys ſmoake,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> and ſmell the wholeſome ayre of their owne pleaſant Countrey; how much more then, ſhould Louers triumph and ioy, when (after manie yeares of abſence) they are comming home towards their Ladies, to haue a ſight of them againe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefeſt foode whereon their hearts doe feede?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philistell,</hi> then ſecluded and ſeparated from his <hi>Iulietta,</hi> ſtaying for a calme and faire winde, to put to the Seas, being by chaunce driuen vpon this vncoth Shore, could not reſt day nor night, hauing this Trumpet of <hi>Loue,</hi> which ſounded alwayes moſt ſhril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in his eares.</p>
               <p>And therefore one morning he roſe very early by breake of day, walking along the Deſart, to ſee if hee could driue away his melancholie thoughts, and by chaunce paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by thoſe Trees, into which the olde Nigromancer had chaunged thoſe wicked Theeues (which purſued the She pheardeſſe, to haue rauiſhed her perforce) hee not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any thing thereof, (and being ignorant of this ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi>) brake a little bough from one of them. When no ſooner had hee done ſo, but (behold) the Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſwell, to writhe, and bend, and to guſh out with bleeding, from that braunch that was ſo broken, caſting forth great ſtore of blood, which fell vpon the ground. At which ſight, <hi>Philistell</hi> was almoſt ſenſeleſſe with the wonder thereof. (For who would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at ſuch a fearefull accident?) Nor did hee well know if he dreamed or waked, but much more was he aſtoniſht, when hee ſaw all his hand bloodie, and the broken arme of the Tree dropping downe blood apace.</p>
               <p>This made him to ſtand ſtone ſtill, to chaunge his colour and countenance, and to looke as one that were readie to fall into an Extaſie or ſownde.<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> No otherwiſe, then the young Scholler that is halfe dead with feare, ſeeing his maiſter behinde him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him (vpon the ſuddaine) as he hath done ſome gricuous fault. Scarce would he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his own eies, to thinke he ſaw ſo ſtrange an euent, as a Tree to diſtill both blood and teares. But this was nothing, to that he was frighted, when he heard the Tree to ſpeake in this manner vnto him. Stay (courteous Shepheard) and hold thy hands, I beſeech thee, contenting thy ſelfe with my moſt miſerable Fortune, without increaſing my miſchiefe anie more, in heaping <hi>Oſſa</hi> vpon <hi>Pelion,</hi> and one diſaſter vpon another, it being a great ſhame, &amp; no ſmall diſparagement vnto mightie men, to afflict ſuch as be plagued alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and who in kindneſſe demaund ſuccour from them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, thou ſhalt vnderſtand, I am a man moſt vnfortunately turned into this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Tree, by a <hi>Magician</hi> abiding in theſe Woods, ſore doubting that I ſhall ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, vnles ſome good bodie or other, maketh interceſſion vnto him in our behalfe, (for more companions haue I in this my miſerie, and as hardly deſtined as my ſelfe) that it would pleaſe him to reſtore vs vnto our former ſhapes and likenes againe.</p>
               <p>Now, if euery offence that is offered, demandeth ſatisfaction, and if this, which thou haſt done vnto me, (drawing moſt violently from me great ſtore of blood) doth merite any fauour at thy hands at all; Then I beſeech thee, for amends of the ſame, to take the paines to ſeeke out this cunning man, &amp; to beg of him ſo much grace for vs, as to turne vs againe into our priſtinate eſtate, and former manner of liuing, vowing (in requitall of the ſame) neuer to commit any wicked outragious behauiour ſo long as we ſhall liue.</p>
               <p>Neuer was <hi>Iuno</hi> more confounded, when ſhe ſaw the periurde <hi>Aeneas</hi> (quite contrary vnto the promiſe that was giuen her) to ſaile in the maine Seas, then was <hi>Philistell,</hi> when he heard this Tree to make this pittifull ſupplication, he being halfe perſwaded, that that time was newely come againe, into which <hi>Niobe</hi> was changed into a Rocke; <hi>Myrrha,</hi> into myrrhe; <hi>Daphne</hi> into laurell; &amp; the companions of <hi>Vliſſes</hi> into Swine. Notwithſtanding, in the end, after he had pluckt vp his hart againe, &amp; called all his ſpirits togither, finding himſelfe to haue done a fault vnto the Tree (&amp; therefore bound, as it were in conſcience, to make him amends) he promiſed to worke what means he could vnto the old man, not only for his owne, but alſo for the reſt of his fellowes deliuerance, &amp; with this reſolution, comforting the poore diſmembred plant as well as he could, he left him, to ſeeke out the old man, who onely and none elſe, could helpe theſe poore wretches thus transformed: whilſt walking alone, &amp; muſing much of this matter, he began to diſcourſe with himſelfe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15406:88"/>in this wiſe. O what a wonderfull thing is this blacke Art, and what great force hath it to bring to paſſe admirable matters?</p>
               <p>Admirable is Magicke, and a thing ſupernaturall; and incredible the effects of ſuch as exerciſe the ſame. No longer will I (now) wonder at the ſorceries of bloodie <hi>Medea,</hi> nor at the Inchantments, of wilie <hi>Circes,</hi> nor at the chaunting witchcrafts and Spells, of ſubtill <hi>Zoraastes,</hi> ſince I haue ſeene with mine owne eyes, ſuch ſtrange and miraculous deuiſes of Magicke. Neither will I maruile more, if theſe three wiſe men, which came to worſhip our Sauiour, came to the knowledge of his diuine natiuitie, by reaſon of their profound learning and skill: when I perceiue and ſee, that a ſillie poore old Magitian, is able to turne mens bodies into inſenſible Trees, this being the cauſe, that all ſuch (as practiſe this kind of Art) are highly honoured and much eſteemed, and eſpecially amongſt ſuch as are infidels, and put ſmall confidence and truſt in the true God.</p>
               <p>So that, if theſe wicked Miniſters of damned diuels, make themſelues to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all men, then how much more ought the true Paſtors &amp; Seruitors of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be reſpected and regarded? For according vnto the bountie, goodnes, and greatnes of the Maiſter, is the ſeruant honoured: and according vnto the baſenes and vilenes of him that he followeth, is he reſpected: which if it be ſo, then of how much eſteeme and account ought the good and faithfull Paſtors of God to be, who walke in his waies, and follow his holie lawes and commandements; ſeeing, that ſuch great honour is attributed vnto the officers of diuels. And if ſuch bad Seruitors, haue ſo great power through the fauour that their Maiſter doth beſtow vpon them, that they are able to change, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and make a tree, a rocke or a brute beaſt of a reaſonable iran; how farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent power and authoritie then ſhall thoſe haue, that are followers of the euerliuing God indeed.</p>
               <p>And certainely their puiſſance and might is great and large, for they not alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer malignant ſpirits, but are (after ſome ſort) more then the Angels themſelues. They haue authoritie ouer Infernall Ghoſts, whom they chaſe away, and make them tremble at their diuine words, in ſuch ſort, as they can doe nothing, where they be in place. A witneſſe is <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who in the abſence of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> wrought ſtrange myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by reaſon of his Art, but in his preſence, and at his praier, was ſeene to fall downe from the aire, and to breake his owne necke, as he tooke vpon him to flie with wings before a number of people. For our Sauiour Chriſt, hauing vanquiſhed the enemie of mankinde, hath of his owne goodnes, left (as an inheritance) the ſame power vnto man himſelfe, through which he is able to breake Sathans necke, bringing him vnder ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and vanquiſhed, who before did vanquiſh, ſo as now, by this meanes men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer diuels, who before did dominier ouer them.</p>
               <p>And that this is true, you may know by many religious Diuines of the word of God, who are of force ſufficient, to driue away wicked ſpirits by their ſpeeches, and in the name of the holy one of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Now, he that draweth and chaſeth away is farre more ſtronger and of greater might, then he that is chaſed, as the enemie, that is vanquiſht for want of courage turneth his backe, and by flying away confeſſeth his want of valour, yeelding himſelfe as priſoner vnto his foe. Then if it be ſo, and that men can make the blacke angels of Lucifer to giue place, and retire, they are farre more ſtrange and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then the other be.</p>
               <p>Beſides, hath not man aduantage aboue the Angels themſelues? in that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſacred and holie communion of our Sauiour, which he hath giuen vnto vs, as a teſtimonie of his diuine loue, and for a perfect pledge, and aſſurance of his grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs.</p>
               <p>Againe, haue not ſome men that vertue, that they can heale diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, (without the helpe of medicines, or pretious potions (onely with their words) yea, and haue there not bene otherſome, that haue had the gift to haue raiſed dead bodies vnto life againe, and yet neuertheleſſe, notwithſtanding that all theſe wonderfull powers are found to be in many of the Miniſters of God: how many wicked perſons are there to be found at this day in the world, who more eſteeme of theſe vile Magitians (atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants vpon the diuell) then of theſe holie and ſacred Preachers, worſhipping that moſt wicked &amp; infamous creature, to leaue the thrice bleſſed and heauenly Creator himſelfe?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15406:89"/>by reaſon of which, they muſt needs leaue, denie, and hate the Church, of which men are appoynted Miniſters, and hating her (without acknowledging her to be their mother) they neuer can obtaine to haue God for their Father. For if the good and faithfull hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, cannot abide to loue, neither can (willingly) ſuffer any ſuch to liue, as be mortall enemies vnto his kind and lawfull wife, becauſe they ſeeke the meanes to oppreſſe her, and to worke her ouerthrow;</p>
               <p>No more (then) will God permit and beare with any ſuch, who goe about to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke and ſpoyle the Church, which is the ſacred and legitimate Spouſe. For what vices ſoeuer be found in the Paſtors of the ſame, yet is ſhe ſtill holie, and propitious vnto our welfare alwaies, euen as (although a Iudge chance to be wicked and bad, Iuſtice it ſelfe neuertheleſſe, is right and iuſt, the Miniſters not being able to defame, nor diſgrace the vertue of that Miniſtrie which they exerciſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is but a fooliſh argument, for one to withdraw himſelfe from the Church, and to giue ouer to come to Gods Temple, to make Interceſſions and Prayers vnto him, for deſpite that the Miniſters liue ill, and are occaſions of many ſcandalls and much reproch vnto the diuine word: not a little degenerating from their former aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent predeceſſors, God hauing (alone) reſerued vnto himſelfe the ſeparation, and the diuiſion of the good and bad, which he will diuide, at the time of his latter iudgement: and therefore, as his garment was not diuided nor parted at all, but kept and conſerued whole, ſo the Church (being a figure of the ſame) cannot be parted, and ſuch as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their fond errour withdraw themſelues from thence, reſemble the Rauen, which lighted vpon the carrion, without returning againe into the Arke, as the faithfull Doue did, all which ſhall periſh in the end, becauſe there is no hope of ſaluation, but from the Church, I meane our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: and therefore is ſhe compared vnto the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> that ſaued mankind from drowning, during that great and terrible deluge of waters. And although that within the ſame ſhip, there were found all kind of liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to doe their filthines therein (for the time) that they remained therein encloſed, yet for all that, <hi>Noah</hi> neuer came forth, but endured all thoſe vnwhole ſome and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſauours, for otherwiſe if he had not kept him ſo immured, he had bene drowned.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the Arke that ſaueth men, is the Church, from forth of which, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can come, vnleſſe he meane to be browned, and loſt in hell fire; in as much as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame, the health of man is encluded and incloſed. Curſed then be he that loueth not the Church, or ſhall thinke, that ſhe is ſtained, polluted, or in any thing at all, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of her dignitie, through the faults of her Paſtors, who are (be they neuer ſo leaude) to be accounted of, becauſe of their profeſſion, eſpecially as long as they ſhall deliuer the verie truth it ſelfe vnto vs, forced thereunto, by the holy orders into which they are inducted: as bad <hi>Casphas,</hi> had the gift of Propheſie (although he will be wicked and ill giuen) by vertue of the pontificall dignitie, through which he had that ſpeciall grace beſtowed vpon him from aboue. And therefore, we may compare our mother Church, vnto a goodly auncient pallace, which thorough continuance of time, and by reaſon of many hard ſtormes and bitter tempeſts (that it hath endured) is much decaied in euery part, the Galleries, chambers, &amp; other chiefe Roomes, being ruinated and fallen flat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, but yet the foundation thereof, ſtandeth ſtrong and ſound, and is not rotten nor periſhed at all. Now the walkes, the lodgings, the hangings and the chiefe beautie of our Church, were the good workes; the charitable deeds, and the wonderfull miracles done by the Apoſtles thereof, in the old world: moſt of which, the corruption of this age, and the vitious liuing of theſe degenerate ſucceſſors, hath ſpoyled, defaced, and trod vnder their feete: and yet notwithſtanding all this, the foundation vpon which ſhe is ſetled and placed, remaineth ſtill vnſhaken, and vndecaied, being ſtrongly built vpon the word of God, who is the chiefe builder and pillar of the ſame. Now that the Miniſters of Gods word, haue bene heretofore much reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, we may finde by the auncient Heathen people, who made more account of them, then many doe (at this daie) who intelleth themſelues with that faire name of Chriſtians. <hi>Abraham</hi> loden with ſpoyles, and returning home victorious ouer Kings (who had taken his brother priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) offered the tenth part of all his rich booties, vnto the high Prieſt <hi>Melchiſedecke, Alexander,</hi> being an Infidell, after the taking of <hi>Tire,</hi> marching towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as a

               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> hauing beſieged the ſelfe ſame Citie, not onely gaue ſeuen dayes of Truce vnto the Prieſts thereof, to celebrate the ſolemne Feaſt, but beſides that, ſent them fatte Bullocks, with garlands and guilded horns, to goe through with their Sacrifices the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>But (comfort your ſelues Religious and godly Diuines) for thriſe bleſſed are all thoſe that ſuffer trouble and perſecution in their bodies, for the name of Ieſus Chriſt-Glorie is the daughter of trauaile and paine, as enuie is the infant of glorie: and onely by trouble and paine, haue the Saints beaten the way for vs to mount to heauen.</p>
               <p>But as ſuch as thinke ſo meanely of Religion, and of the Prelates thereof, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be as meanely accounted of: euen ſo (highly) are ſuch to be eſteemed, that haue giuen them there due, and rightly honoured them.

               <p>Herewithall, the Knight comming vnto him, ſaluted him with great curteſie, in this

Learned and reſpectiue Father, God proſper thy yeares, prolong thy life, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie thy daies, &amp; conſerue and keepe thee ſtill in health. Let me intreate thee a while to ſtay, and a little to reſt thy ſelfe in this place, whileſt I ſhall be bolde to deliuer a fewe words vnto thee.</p>
               <p>The Gods ſometimes lend their cares vnto mortall men, neither doe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to heare them, as thou makeſt ſhew (me thinkes) as if thou art loth to liſten vnto mine.</p>
               <p>Stay then (reuerend old man) and giue not iuſt cauſe vnto me, that I may conceiue any vnkindnes, through this thy harſh and hard deniall. Nothing is of ſmaller account then the ſpeech of man, who ſo yeeldeth not vnto that, will yeeld vnto nothing.</p>
               <p>The old man, ſeeing himſelfe to be held by the hand, and vrged ſo hardly (as it were ſomewhat in choller replied thus) <hi>Palmer,</hi> thou art too troubleſome and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, let me goe I would wiſh thee, &amp; hinder me no longer from the ſeruice of the Gods, about which I am now going, leſt thou force me to doe that which I would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for what thou wouldeſt haue, I know alreadie before thou ſpeakeſt.</p>
               <p>Thy requeſt is not lawfull, inaſmuch as Iuſtice ſhould be wronged, and rightly might ſhe complaine of me, if I ſhould yeeld vnto thy demand: giue ouer then thy vaine ſute, for no bodie is bound to doe what is ill and vniuſt, at the requeſt of another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ought to make more account of Iuſtice, then of all the world beſides: and for that no amitie or affection is to be preferred before a reaſonable and righfull matter: Heare me therefore, and diſquiet not my minde, which is now buſied about heauenly things, and thinke I loue thee well, to let thee goe ſeotfree, when thou ſhalt vrge me, with ſuch an vnreaſonable motion as this: for Iuſtice puniſheth as well thoſe that ſeeme to allow of euill, as thoſe that doe commit euill themſelues. Pardon me (graue ſir) (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the knight) there is no man liuing that leſſe alloweth of euill then I doe, which I hate, loath and deſpiſe: but I cannot chuſe but I muſt needs loue pittie and mercie, for as we are all men, ſo are we bound, one to helpe another, the bruite beaſtes themſelues doing the like through the verie inſtinct of Nature. Compaſſion ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all other reſpects, becauſe a fault that is done, may be amended and become a vertue, but a man once dead for want of pittie, neuer riſeth againe, and his loſſe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable, and can neuer be repaired againe.</p>
               <p>Mercie hath alwaies gotten the vpper hand of rigour and fiercenes, and the pittifull man doth deſerue more then the iuſt, whereof <hi>Coſar</hi> ſhall ſerue me for a witneſſe, who affirmed, that the fruites of his victories, was the pardon, he (daily) gaue vnto thouſands of his enemies, aſſoone as they ſought his fauour. What nouriſheth the ſocietie and companie of men? What maintaineth their liues, and what increaſeth their health and quietnes, but milde pittie? If there were none but hungrie wolfes, or greedie Lyons, how (then) ſhould the world endure? and how could men be ſure to enioy their liues in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Ah if our moſt louing God (ſhould be found (as thou art) without mercie, what hope ſhould we haue to enioy eternall glorie? but rather looke (euerie houre) when we ſhould be ſwallowed vp into the bottomleſſe gulfe of hell. Change then this thy too too obdurate reſolution.</p>
               <p>The exceeding great curteſies that <hi>Alexander</hi> vſed vnto the Perſian Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and wife, was the cauſe that <hi>Darius</hi> prayed the Gods, that if he needs muſt be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of the throne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he might haue no other ſucceſſour to follow him, then the ſame <hi>Alexander</hi> his chiefe enemie. Great account doe we make, and much doe we eſteeme of great and noble perſonages, that haue liued long before our daies, yet not ſo much for the many victories they obtained, as for the kind gentlenes, and milde cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies they vſed vnto their foes, when they had ouercome their owne paſſions. For to conquer an enemie is the benefit of Fortune, whereas that which we win and carrie away from our owne ſelues, cannot be attributed vnto any thing but vnto our ſelues, and that is the victorie which conſiſteth in pardoning of our enemies. Then follow this direct courſe, and thy memorie ſhall flouriſh for euer.</p>
               <p>O how ignorant doeſt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to be (replied the old man) by this thy diſcourſe. Who knoweth not that euerie one of vs is bound for our owne credits, to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our affections, and to ſhew grace vnto our aduerſarie, vnto whom Fortune hath left no meanes to defend himſelfe, when he is once vanquiſht.</p>

               <p>So likewiſe the ſelfe-ſame <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom thou painteſt forth to be ſo kind, defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to puniſh in moſt cruell ſort, the murtherers of <hi>Darius,</hi> cauſing them to be peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale torne with wilde horſes in ſunder. No reaſon is it, that, that man, ſhould be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to liue, who is not moued to reuenge Iuſtice when ſhe is profaned and wronged, ſhe being that vertue, that containeth within her all the other, and they are all (as it were) tied about her necke, inaſmuch as it were to no purpoſe for one to be ſober, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, if he ſhould proue to be an vniuſt man, and an vſurper ouer other men.</p>
               <p>And were Iuſtice honoured of euery one (as ſhe ought to be in right) we then ſhould haue but ſmall neede, either of force, valour, or prowes at all. For ſhould euerie man liue orderly and well, giuing vnto his neighbour that which is his due, there ſhould be no occaſion, to vſe force to compell him to deale iuſtly and true: ſtand not then, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune me thus, to ſhew compaſſion vpon the foes of Iuſtice, &amp; hinder not the diuine vengeance of the ſame, leſt thou be puniſhed for taking their parts ſo much.</p>
               <p>For curſed is he that beareth with vice, and winketh with his eies, becauſe he will not ſee that fault, which he is loth to puniſh. Learned Father (anſwered the knight) how much more eaſier is it for a man to pardon, then to reuenge?</p>
               <p>A ſmall labour were it, and little or no time would it aske, to ſpeake this one onely word (I pardon them) but not ſo qucikly, is found the meanes to reuenge. Happie may he account himſelfe, that hath not a cruell minde, nor bloodie hand, the Lord himſelfe reiecting the ſacrifices of ſuch as haue rough and bloodie hands.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the ſame Iuſtice in whoſe behalfe thou alleageſt ſo much, is content that that ſinner be receiued into grace, that craueth pardon for his fault, he promiſing to make hartle ſatisfaction for the ſame. For what more can one demand of the offender, but amends for the offence he hath committed.</p>
               <p>Iuſtice miſliketh not, to ſee her deare ſiſter Mercie, to be reſpected and ſued vnto, becauſe that without yeelding ſatisfaction for the crime, and not paying what is due vnto Iuſtice, ſhe neuer receiueth the miſliuer into her fauour.</p>
               <p>That good Father, did not he take againe into his former grace, his prodigall child, after he had ſo vainely and prodigally ſpent all his wealth and patrimonie? And that wilde King <hi>Loies,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Debonaire,</hi> did not he forgiue all his children, who had chaſed him out of his kingdome, depriued him of his Crowne, and had forcibly made him a Monke? If ſo, then let him be mercifull that looketh for mercie: for as we ſowe, ſo ſhall we reape. And if we doe otherwiſe, we ſhall prooue our ſelues but liars before God, and cruell of our ſpeech before the face of the world. Let vs pittie one another as we would be pittied againe of God himſelfe: for if he ſhould but once looke into our faults, who then dare appeare before his preſence?</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon I am ſo earneſt with thee, to the end I might obtaine ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at thy hands, as to reſtore thoſe poore diſtreſſed ſoules, vnto their priſtinate and former ſhapes againe, that they may be continually obliged vnto thee, for ſo great a bountie towards them.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt not (anſwered the old man) what thou demandeſt.

               <p>O troubleſome and vnquiet Sunne, who hath cauſed thee (ſo ſoone to leaue thy bed, before thy wonted time?

For then, (at my pleaſure) I did contemplate and behold the face of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhining in the heauens, which nouriſhed in my ſoule, the remembraunce of my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>And what can delight me more, then to thinke on her, who reſembleth her much, and who it honoured with her name? Nothing pleaſeth the ſicke man ſo much as his health, which he deſireth aboue all things, (although many times) in vaine. And ſo, nothing is ſo much agreeable to me, as my faire Miſtris, whome I doe often wiſh for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to no ende. For the pale and breathleſſe coarſe, layde vpon the colde ground, is not more depriued of life,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> then I am voyd of all hope, to ſee my cruell Faire againe.</p>
               <p>Miſerable is hee that languiſheth without all hope: for nothing ſweeteth the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his wound, when as a little hope alone, is of force to nouriſh the pooreſt wretches in the world. Eaſie are the trauailes, and gentle the paines, that one ſuffereth, whilſt he hopeth; For the conceit of the delight of the thing he hopeth for, maketh them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, changing them into contentment and ioy: whereas the labour and paine of him that is in diſpaire of all hope, is moſt dangerous, inſupportable, and intollerable.</p>
               <p>Tell me mine eyes, to what end doe you ſee and giue light, if you can no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her, who was your chiefeſt delight? O faire and louely <hi>Diana,</hi> in what place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is thy Fortune (as now) to bee, making the ſame bleſſed with thy beautious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; Heauens graunt that thou mayeſt liue happilie, and that the remnant of all my good Fortunes (if at leaſt I haue any reſerued for me) be heaped &amp; beſtowed vpon thee, whilſt I in the meane ſpace, will liue (here) alone, in this ſolitary Wood, to bewaile my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, and languiſh daily, as one in a conſumption, that piecemeale pineth away, and can neuer be cured. For to what end doth he make interceſſion, or praiers vnto the Heauens, whom the Heauens themſelues doe holde for their enemie? That man that is difaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtined, hath no reaſon to expect any good fortune: which if he doth, he but moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe, and in the end doth finde he is deceiued.</p>
               <p>So I looke for nothing that is comfortable or pleaſing to come from aboue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know my ſelfe to be in the number of thoſe miſerable Caitifs,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> who (neuer haue felt any thing here) in this world, but woe and diſtreſſe, vntill they haue bene layed and lodged within their graues.</p>
               <p>O too too partiall Fates of men, that ſome ſhould be ſtill happy, luckie, and bleſſed in euery thing, and others ſo vnfortunate, that they ſhould (neuer) taſte of aught but of ſorrow, care, and anguiſh! And of this laſt accurſed crue I am the chiefe.</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſome will ſay: Eucry one feeleth his owne griefe and misfortune, but not that which another is tormented withall. Yet let ſuch iudge (but indifferently of my caſe) and then I know they cannot chuſe but pittie me; For is it not an euill to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for one to looſe the cheerfull light of his owne ſweete life, his much deſired health and well-fare, his owne louing natiue Countrey, his deare Parents, and his affectionate friends and acquaintance, without finding any ſuccour or reliefe at all, but of his proper enemies. For vaine is the helpe of them, from whom I hoped, and as bootleſſe is the reward of my trauaile, that I am like to receiue of ſuch as I ſerued.</p>
               <p>O miſerie worſe then diſpaire it ſelfe, for one to be beholding for his good Fortune vnto his mortallfoe, and not finde recompence, of thoſe of whome he hath ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>

               <p>And ſuch was thy Fortune braue <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> exiled by thine owne people, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained moſt louingly by the <hi>Spartanes,</hi> thy hatefull deadly foes.

               <p>Thus ſaide the ſorrowfull <hi>Arcas,</hi> who (hauing ended his diſcourſe) was choſen as ludge betweene the old man and the Knight, about their firſt Argument.

               <p>Wherevppon, the Shepheard demaunded of her the cauſe of her comming into this vncoth Deſart, and by what chaunce ſhee came thither: As alſo the reaſon why theſe cruell lawleſſe perſons did purſue her with their naked ſwordes, in ſuch a ſtraunge manner.</p>
               <p>And therewithall, they ſat downe vpon a greene banke, placing the Nymphe in the middeſt of them, who began to tell this ſad Tale following.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince, there was a certaine Noble man of an Iſland,<note place="margin">Delia the Shepherdeſſe, reporteth a ſtrange hiſtory</note> who became amorous of a goodly Maid, ſhe being the onely child he had. This Damoſell had vowed her ſelfe vnto the ſeruice of the Goodeſſe <hi>Iuno;</hi> Which her Father not knowing of, purſued her the more eagerly, ſhe ſtill denying, and flying from him, as much as ſhe could, calling vpon her Miſtris to aſſiſt and helpe her.</p>
               <p>One day amongſt others, hee found her at ſuch an aduantage, as he attempted by force to rauiſh her: which ſhamefull deed, was repugnant againſt all reaſon, honor, and honeſtie.</p>
               <p>The Virgin not knowing what to doe, reſiſted and cried out, imploring for the aide of <hi>Iuno,</hi> who ſeeing ſuch vnnaturall vſage of a Father vnto his owne Child, delayed no longer to helpe her: For as the luſtfull Lord, thought to haue embraced his daughter, and to haue had his pleaſure of her, in ſteed of holding a liuing bodie in his armes, he found a cold and ſenſleſſe image of white Marble. The Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> hauing chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her faithfull ſeruant into this liueleſſeforme to preſerue her chaſtitie vndefiled.</p>
               <p>The Father wonderfully amazed at this matter, but more ſadde and heauie was he, (as well for the loſſe of his onely childe, whom he loued as his owne ſoule, as alſo to ſee that he was depriued from enioying of that contentment which hee hoped of) was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in a manner to kill himſelfe for verie meere griefe and vexation: when vppon the ſuddaine, he found out, that the Maid had vowed herſelfe vnto <hi>Iuno,</hi> and that, that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, to the ende to fruſtrate him of his will, had turned her into this colde forme of Marble.</p>
               <p>Which when he knew, madde for rage and griefe againſt <hi>Iuno,</hi> (it being not the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any creature to murmure or bandie againſt the Celeſtiall powers) he runneth vnto the Altar, plucking downe her Image, and breaking it in a thouſand pieces.</p>
               <p>The Goddeſſe being iuſtly moued with this outrage, prouoked her husband <hi>Iupiter</hi> likewiſe againſt him, who tooke this iniurie done vnto his wife, in as hainous a manner, as if it had bene done vnto himſelfe: and therefore (to reuenge the ſame, he ſent an infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious peſtilence into this Iland, of which, all the land (in a manner died.)

               <p>But after they had ſome fewe yeares bene tired with their baniſhment, and (as wearie of this hungrie and vnpleaſant place where they did bide, deſiring and longing to ſee the ſmoake of their olde Chimneys) they ventured to returne back againe into their owne Countrey: where no ſooner were they ſetled, but the ſame peſtilent diſeaſe beganne (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh) to ſeaze vpon them, taking them away as faſt as euer it had done before.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon they ſent vnto the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to know how they might be freed of this plague: who returned them anſwer, that to appeaſe the wrath of <hi>Iuno,</hi> they muſt ſacrifice a young Virgin vnto her, ſhee being euery way as faire in beautie, as that Virgin was, which <hi>Iuno</hi> had chaunged into a picture of Marble.</p>
               <p>They heating this, began to bethinke themſelues what they ſhould doe in this caſe, for their Iland brought forth no ſuch comely creatures, and therefore they determined to ſcoure all the Coaſts neere about, to ſee if they could finde anie ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now after the damnable Fiend <hi>Diſcord,</hi> with her breath, like brimſtone, her wings, like a Dragon, and her pawes, all of fire: had driuen that gratious and goodly companie out of the ſweet Groues of <hi>Arcadia:</hi> euery one (highing him vnto his owne home, after the death of that valiant Lord <hi>Phillis</hi>) ſo much bewailed and lamented of euery one. I alone, amongſt the reſt, reſolued with my ſelfe, not to ſtirre one foote from thence, but to take my Fortune patiently (as it ſhould happen) not vnlike vnto a Lamb that is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, <hi>Report</hi> had blaſted abroad the beautious faces of all our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes, (which ſometime were biding in this happie Deſart) carrying the ſame tyed vnto his wings, brought it vnto the eares of the men of this cruell Hand: who no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner heard it, but that they took ſhippe, minding to take one of the faireſt Maidens there, and to ſacrifice her vnto the Goddeſſe of Riches.</p>
               <p>Comming (then) a ſhore vpon our Iland, and not finding any more to pleaſe their fancie, then my poore ſelfe, they tooke me perforce, and brought me priſoner into their ſhip, hoping that I ſhould be a remedie to mittigate the anger of the Goddeſſe; and not becauſe I was ſaire enough for their purpoſe. But ſuch as deſire any thing, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with little. Like vnto right Gameſters, who rather then they will be excluded from play, will play at ſmall ſtakes, and holde the candle vnto the reſt: So they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined any beautie, were it neuer ſo ſimple, would ſerue well enough for their turne and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I ſeeing my ſelfe (thus) taken, like vnto a ſillie Partridge, ſeazed vpon by the gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Faulconer, (and ſore doubting what the other Virgin feared) lifting vp my deawy eyes vnto the heauens, I made mine humble and hartie prayer vnto the Almightie, to aſſiſt me in this extremitie, and to deliuer me out of the hands of theſe monſters, whom I doubted ſore, becauſe of mine honor. And no ſooner had I made interceſſion vnto him, but hee, as a moſt mercifull Father, heard my prayers, gaue eare vnto my cries, and pittied my wofull teares. For within a while after, he cauſed a blutering ſtorme and Tempeſt to riſe in the Seas, that draue them farre away from their owne Coaſt, forcing them in the ende, to caſt Anker vppon theſe parts. Which being done, I did coniure and intreat them ſo much, that they permitted mee to come a ſhore to take the ayre, ſomewhat to refreſh and recouer my crazed health, which the rage of the Tempeſt, and the ſwelling billowes of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> had much impaired and made worſe. But no ſooner was I vpon the land, and had ſet foote on the ground, then I began (ſuddainly) to take my heeles, and runne from them, chuſing rather to be killed by them as I fled, then they ſhould take from me mine honour violently.</p>
               <p>And being in this minde, I thought to venter my fortune, as that young Romane Virgin did, which brauely ſwum ouer the Riuer of <hi>Tiber,</hi> thinking there was no other way with mee, but that either death, or flying away, could ſaue my chaſtitic vntainted, and preſerue me vnhart. They ſeeing this, followed after mee as faſt as they could runne, threatning me with many outragious and iniurious tearmes, to cut my throate if I ſtayed not: And this had they done, had not you (deare Father) come to reſcue me,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15406:95"/>by your learned and miraculous aide: for which I moſt humblie thanke you, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my ſelfe, by your onely meanes and fauour, to hold both mine honour, and my life, (for both which) I am obliged vnto you.</p>
               <p>This pittifull diſcourſe moued all the aſſembly to compaſſion, and eſpecially the old man, who gaue her many kinde ſpeeches, comforting her in the beſt manner he could, and ſo left her to repoſe her ſelfe, becauſe ſhe was wonderfull wearie.</p>
               <p>And in the meane time, he ſingled out <hi>Arcas,</hi> whom he led vnto the old ſolitarie Dungion or Caue, ſommoning him to goe forward in the Hiſtorie of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>The Shepheard hearing this, began to chafe in his minde, as a little boy doth fret, when he is forced to repeate his leſſon twiſe. But it is to no end to be angrie, for he durſt not diſpleaſe him any way, becauſe he ſore doubted his diuelliſh cunning, vnto whom not for loue, but rather for feare, he willingly ſeemed to condiſcend, beginning where he left, in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> (as I told you before) tooke great pleaſure in my verſes, yea, and did me grace (ſometimes) to ſing ſome of them her owne ſelfe. But as the raine transformeth and chaungeth it ſelfe into colde ſharpe ſnow, ſo this pleaſure turned into griefe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, by the anſwere I receiued of the cruell <hi>Ecco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet neuertheleſſe, I thought to follow my game, hauing alreadie rouſed the dame. He that will be a ſouldiour in Loues campe, muſt neuer be faint-harted, nor giue ouer with a repulſe, or ſome ſmall loſſe, for continuance of time, and milde patience, are the ſacred Ttees, from which loyall Louers, gather the fruits of their conſtant perſeuerance, and long looked for Amitie.</p>
               <p>This was the cauſe I put forth my ſelfe to ſerue my <hi>Diana,</hi> more then euer I had done before, although ſhe accounted nothing at all thereof, by reaſon ſhe was addicted wholie vnto the ſeruice of her Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, I alwaies hoped the beſt, ruminating in my ſelfe, that <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in one day, and, that that was rare and daintie, could not be gotten eaſilie, but at a high price and dearely.</p>
               <p>I remembred, that ſmall drops of water, with ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling, maketh (in the end) a hole in the flintie ſtone, be it neuer ſo hard, and I relied verie much vpon the promiſe of time, who vanteth to ripen euerie thing, ſo they ſtay his leiſure. A ſmall hope encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſuch as be Louers, and hindereth them from giuing ouer their ſuite begun already. Wherein, they reſemble ſuch ſouldiours as are beſieging ſome Cittie or other, in which they hope in the end to enter, although they haue the worſt at the firſt. And ſo Louers, neuer diſpaire, for all their croſſes, and ouerthwartings, but ſtill hope the beſt, as the Sunne, which waxeth the clearer, the more the clouds ſeeke to ſhadow him. This made me ſtill to follow my footing, as the good Blood-hound doth the trace of the Deare.</p>
               <p>When the day of the ſolemne feaſt of <hi>Diana</hi> drew neare, which was the day of ioy, and yeare of Iubile to all, but vnto me (alone) heauie and ſad, I then (againe) began to weepe &amp; waile afreſh: for no remedie was there, but my Miſtris muſt needs goe thither, with the other Nymphs her companions, whilſt I (in the meane while) ſhould want her pleaſing companie. For to follow her it was not lawfull, which both her honour forbad me, and alſo the ſacrifices and miſteries were ſuch, and ſo ſeruile, as none might ſee them but women.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I remembred the fault which <hi>Clodius</hi> committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> prophaning &amp; defaming, the ceremonies of the Goddeſſe <hi>Bona:</hi> to the intent he might enioy the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall companie of <hi>Caeſars</hi> wife, which offence brought forth manie other. The Iudges being (through the ſame) corrupted, and the Iniuſtice which they did (in abſoluing the guiltie) without puniſhment.</p>
               <p>I calling all theſe things to minde, ſuffered my Ladie to goe vnto theſe ſacrifices, which continued diuers daies, whileſt I (in the meane while) was left alone, at what time, I began to find, how heauie and greuous the abſence of this Ladie is vnto the Louer, whileſt I tried the ſame all that ſpace within my ſelfe. Yet, although ſhe was abſent, I was not altogether idle, for I compoſed theſe Heroicall verſes following.</p>

               <p>Hauing made theſe verſes, I plaide as the countrie Farmeth doth, who hauing gathered ſome daintie, or new kind of fruite, keepeth the ſame verie charily, to make a preſent thereof, vnto his Land-lord, vpon the firſt occaſion he ſhall haue to ſee him: and ſo I reſolued to keepe theſe my verſes, and to preſent them vnto my <hi>Diana,</hi> aſſoone as ſhe ſhould returne from the ceremonies of her Goddeſſe, and long was it (as me thought) that ſhe ſtaied. For to one that expecteth &amp; looketh for any thnig, euery houre ſeemeth a yeare at the leaſt. Willingly could I haue murmured againſt the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> If I durſt, and more willingly haue curtold of, and ſhortned her Sacrifices, if I had bene (as I was not) the great Prieſt of the Gods.</p>
               <p>But in the end, the beſt thing that I could finde to helpe me, was patience perforce, whileſt I attended with good deuotion, the will of the heauens, which at the laſt brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth euery thing to his perfection. Yet when theſe Sacrifices were at an end, they were no more fortunate vnto me, then was their beginning. For my <hi>Diana</hi> being elected and choſen Queene of theſe Myſteries, by the other Nymphs was conducted (not farre from thence) by the whole troupe of them to be enſtalled, &amp; to receiue the Robes of her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Soueraigntie, much did it pleaſe me, that my Ladie was ſo highly honoured, but as much (againe) did it diſpleaſe me, that I ſhould loſe her preſence longer, for the ſame; which was the cauſe, it drowned and choaked all the contentment and pleaſure, which I conceiued of her prehemmence, and to know her, to be preferred before all the reſt of the Goddeſſe traine. For the good ſeruant is not a little glad and proud, in that he ſerueth a braue and vertuous Maiſter, who ſurpaſſeth all others in vertue, and in chiualrie.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Louer is fullie contented, and not a little doth glorie, when he is the ſeruant of ſuch a Ladie, as not Loue (alone) maketh her ſeeme beautifull in his owne ſight, but when ſhe is ſo reputed and accounted of by the voice of all men.</p>
               <p>Nothing delighteth our mindes more, then when we ſee euery mans conceit to iumpe with our owne, in the thing that we loue moſt of all.</p>
               <p>Now the honour that was attributed vnto my Miſtris was great, for ſhe was brought from the temple, arrayed with a fine and daintie robe, of white lawne; vnder which was a garment of cloth of golde, rich, &amp; of great valew, her head was adorned, &amp; embolliſhed with a Royall golden Crowne, and the louely traces of her flaxen haire, were tied with ſmall and delicate colours of the pureſt ſilke, ſet out with many prettie knots, ànd won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull rare deuiſes.</p>
               <p>Her countenance was ſuch, and ſo Maieſticall, as if ſhe had bene the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> indeed: for apparell ſetteth out the bodie verie much, being one of the goodheſt and chiefeſt ornaments to encreaſe beautie: eſpecially if there be good ſtore of change of the ſacred and coſtly, with ill, and that it be fit and well made for the perſon that ſhall weare it.</p>
               <p>Her Chariot was of Iuorie, wherein ſhe ſat inthronized, drawne with foure huge Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſhaked their yellow rough skinnes, to make ſuch ſtubborne harts to feare and quake, that were loth to bow, and doe reuerence vnto their beautious and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>Before her, and by her ſide, the other Nymphs marched orderly, and in a row, euery one of them, carrying a braunch of Oliue, wreathed and intermixed with a bowe of greene Laurell, and a writing vpon the ſame, which bare euerie ones owne <hi>Quatrin</hi> in praiſe of this royall Nymph, whereof ſome of them were theſe here vnder inſerted.</p>

               <p>How pleaſing this ſong was vnto mine eares, you may (kinde Father) eaſilie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeeing it was ſo much in the commendation of my Ladie: for the faithfull Louer indeed, maketh more account of the honour and credit of his Miſtris, then of his owne, and whoſo doth otherwiſe, is not a true ſeruant, but a deſpitefull enemie.</p>
               <p>This feaſt continued a long time, being both grieuous, and gladſome vnto me; firſt grieuous, becauſe I could not haue thee companie of my deare <hi>Diana,</hi> and then ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to ſee how much it did redowne vnto her honour.</p>
               <p>For the deſire of glorie is ſo ſweet, that as ſugar ſweetneth ſuch things as are moſt bitter, ſo it maketh all paines and troubles ſeeme light and pleaſant: I wiſhing in my minde, that my FAITH might growe to be famous, rather then mine owne ſelfe, which was the reaſon, I did the better endure to be abſent from her, becauſe I perceiue that it was for her renowne. This made me haue patience perforce, which I eaſilie broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by reaſon I ſawe that in my minde during all theſe Solemnities pleaſed me, as much as that thing did, for which I ſo eagerly and earneſtlie attended and lookt for.</p>
               <p>Willingly would I haue thruſt my ſelfe amongſt them to daunce, to haue aſſiſted thereſt, according vnto my ſlender power, and to haue (the more) praiſed my Ladie, but I durſt not, neither would they haue receiued me into their companie, I knowing, that mortall things ought not to be mingled with diuine, and that nothing could vnite and ioyne together the high Empire of <hi>Inpirer,</hi> with the baſe ruling of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Yet in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15406:98"/>meane time, I was ſo fooliſh in my conceits, that (I thought) it grieued my Deare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe could not haue leiſure to ſpeake vnto me: but I was farre wide from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the pleaſure and glorie which inuironed her round about, drowned all other ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, excepting onely that, wherewith ſhe was ſo highly honored.</p>
               <p>And had not this carryed her minde away, and buſied it about the ſame, yet had ſhe neuer (ſo much) as once thought vpon mee, becauſe ſhee did not affect me at all: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bare me any good will, but as ſhe did ordinarily vnto others.</p>
               <p>Such is the humour of Louers, that judge euery one by their owne ſelues, as if it were neceſſarie and expedient that euery one ſhould be as fond, as they themſelues are fooliſh. What ſhould I ſay more, but that as one rauiſhed through too much ioy, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my Goddeſſe ſo earneſtly, and with ſuch zeale, as I perſwaded my ſelfe, ſhe was the true Goddeſſe indeed: and therevpon I imagined, that ſhe being raiſed to ſo high a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, would (no more account of me, then ſhe had done heretofore) of my verſes: for (commonly) proſperitie maketh men inſolent and proude. And yet againe, I was not a little glad of her good Fortunes, becauſe I geſſed that by that meanes, none could rightly blame me, for being an Attendant vpon ſo excellent a Virgin as ſhee was: who was ſo reſpectiuely vſed of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Paſſing well did I like of their Deuiſes and Sonnets, but onely for one thing, which was, that in one place, they prayed and wiſhed her, that ſhee ſhould not make account of <hi>Loue:</hi> and this one word was it, that made mee thinke the worſe of all the reſt of the Song: as one limbe of a man cut off from his bodie, deformeth all the reſt of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage.</p>
               <p>But you need not to wonder, that I tooke this matter ſo hainouſly, for I (forſooth) thought I had ſome intereſt in her, when indeed there was no ſuch thing. I afterwards bethinking my ſelfe, that if ſhe would haue diſpoſed of her ſelfe to loue, ſhe then would haue choſen ſome one farre more worthie then I was, on whome to caſt her good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, I excuſed the Nymphes, for that which they had ſaide, knowing that it pleaſed their Princeſſe well, to make ſuch a motion vnto her: and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought I was not likely (in haſt) to be the man whome ſhee meant to affect. What will you more? The feaſt (was now) at an ende, my Ladie tooke againe her owne former apparell, returned vnto her olde place and meadow, and there liued as ſhee was wont to doe.</p>
               <p>No ſooner did I ſee her, but that I played the humble Publican, looking vpon her a ſarre off, and not once daring to approach nigh vnto her: doubting leaſt I ſhould find her more hautie and furlie then before-times, by reaſon of her great aduancement, and good fortunes beſtowed on her. And yet I hoped my verſes would be an occaſion that I ſhould haue acceſſe vnto her, although (to ſay the truth) I feared greatly that ſhe would not much care, neither for them, nor for me: Holding them (thus) in my hand, and not daring to preſent them vnto her. One while I tooke them out of my pocket, thinking to offer them vnto her, and ſo ſtood doubtfull betweene both what to doe: Not vnlike vnto a young ſcholler, who (whilſt hee is going vnto his maiſter, to craue licence to goe play) hath many conceits running in his head, not daring (when hee commeth before him) to begge leaue, for feare leaſt he ſhould be denyed.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes I repented me that euer I had deuiſed them, ſeeing I had loſt ſo much time and leiſure to write them out<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the ende, I tooke courage, knowing the worſt was but a deny all: hoping well of her, becauſe I was well aſſured that the frutes of the Muſes were honoured and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, euen of their owne enemies, yea and of the moſt worſt and leaudeſt people in the world.</p>
               <p>Drawing nigh then, I (preſently) perceiued the excellencie of my Miſtris ſpirit, for I found her more affable then ſhee was, before ſhe had bene ſo much aduaunced in houor. I ſaw her to be one of thoſe wiſe Sages, who are neither puffed vp with aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good Fortune, nor taken downe, through too extreame miſeries of the ſame. I perceiued that firme conſtancie lodged in her ſoule, and that ſhe caried the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in proſperitie, as ſhe would haue done, if ſhe had bene in aduerſitie.</p>

So that if whilſt I liue, I can hardly keepe mine honour from blame, yet when I am dead, I cannot preſerue it from the ſuſpition thereof, it being become a prey vnto moſt venemous and ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues; For this I will tell thee (Shepheard) the preſence of a man (oftentimes.) withholdeth manie things from being ſpoken againſt his credit and good name, which when hee is abſent, the miſchieuous and malignant ſort will not ſticke to report and blaze abrode.</p>

               <p>But of her that is chaſt, ſober, and well qualified, a man cannot ſpeak, but with great aduiſe, and mature deliberation, as when wee ſpeake of the Gods, becauſe we haue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in her.</p>
               <p>Then is it but a hard interpretation, to thinke that the modeſt and regardfull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, of a loyall Louer, bring any diſparagement vnto the faire vertues of his louely Miſtris: when ſhe ſhall ſo highly be praiſed, in that ſhe hath with ſtood ſo many ſtrong aſſaults of ſuch as haue laide batterie againſt the inuincible Fort of her admirable chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and when euerie one ſhall ſee, and reade, of her more then rare qualities, drawne and painted forth in their liuely and right colours, with the cunning penſill of the loftie verſe of her moſt faithfull ſeruant.</p>
               <p>And after this manner (O diuine <hi>Diana</hi>) doe I pretend to write of thee, and make thee famous, and when thou findeſt that I meane otherwiſe, then let moſt ſhamefull death befall mee; defacing and ouerthrowing mee, and my writings, as moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be ſeene, or looked vppon, or (once to be remembred) within the memories of man.</p>

               <p>After the faire Nymph had made an end of her diſmall hiſtorie, ſhe ſpake thus vnto me. Now (Shepheard) confeſſe, confeſſe (I ſay) by this example, the vniuſt crueltie of Loue. He that will not yeeld neither vnto preſidents, nor vnto reaſons, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a moſt obſtinate and ignorant perſon; for it is more follie, not to ſubmit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reaſon, then to be altogether vnacqainted with the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is an old ſaid ſawe, that he is happie, whom other mens harmes can make to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. For to growe wiſe, at the charges of another, and not at his owne coſt, is a greater treaſure then the golden ſands of the riuer <hi>Pactotus.</hi> As for mine owne part, this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (with diuers others) which I can report, and all vnto this purpoſe, wherein Loue hath ſhewed thouſand proofes of his bloodie rage) ſhall make me wiſe, and warne me to looke vnto my ſelfe well enough.</p>
               <p>They ſay that a man ſhould take heed of a mad dog, of a franticke bedlem, and of a notable Drunkard, becauſe by nature they are apt to doe ſhrowd turnes. And euen ſo, we ſhould looke vnto our ſelues, leſt we ſhould fall into the laps of Loue, ſeeing we know him to be ſo peruerſe, ſo wicked, and vniuſt: for he ſhall neuer be moned, who moſt ſondly flingeth himſelfe into the pit, that hath bene ſhewed vnto him before.</p>
               <p>Then (Shepheard) ſhalt thou be wiſe if (betimes) thou withdraweſt thy ſelfe from ſuch a Tyrant: &amp; fooliſh, will I account thee, if thou imagineſt that I will euer follow ſo bad a maiſter as he is, his ſchoole reſembling an intricate labyrinth, into which it is eaſy to enter, but impoſſible (or verie hard) to get out of it againe. He that will doe well, muſt neuer doe any thing whereof he may repent him afterward; for a man neuer drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, but when he languiſheth through feare, ſtill looking for that miſchiefe to happen, which will at the laſt make him to repent. If I know (alreadie) that repentance would not be faire off from me, if I ſhould loue, by reaſon of the dammages that proceed through the ſame, were not I (then) verie ſimple to goe about to loue? Then talke no more vnto me of ſuch vanities, but rather diſcourſe with me of ſuch Ceremonies, Fraiers, vowes and Sacrifices belonging vnto <hi>Diana,</hi> which are mine ordinarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. For euerie workeman delighteth to here talke of his owne Science or Miſterie. I hearing her ſay ſo, replied thus.</p>
               <p>O fairer creature then <hi>Venus;</hi> more chaſte then <hi>Polixena,</hi> and more learned then <hi>Caſſandra;</hi> The braue Captaine that continually followeth the warres, knoweth well,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15406:109"/>that his function or calling, is full of dangerand trouble, and yet (in the meane while) he repenteth not, to follow the ſame, becauſe of the hope he hath to reape renowme and credit, which is encountred and wonne, euen in the middeſt and the thickeſt of Cannon ſhot, of the battaile. And ſo, although the Louer doubteth not, but that he is like to endure great troubles and turmoiles in his amorous purſuit, yet doth not he giue ouer the following thereof, without repenting himſelfe at all, becauſe the hope to pleaſe that which he ſo much liketh, bringeth the thoughts of all his troubles and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to be very weake, and of no force or violence at all.</p>
               <p>The ſicke patient, which taketh a potion, knoweth that it is bitter, and yet for all that, he ſticketh not to ſwallow it downe moſt willingly, by reaſon of the firme confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he hath to be healed of his griefe.</p>
               <p>That the paines of loue are bitter and cruell, I cannot but confeſſe; yet then (againe) we muſt remember, how ſweet and luſcious is that ioy, that the Louer participateth of, when he ſeeth himſelfe beloued of his Miſtris.</p>
               <p>An ineſtimable lewell is not gotten, nor giuen for nothing, neither ſuch and ſo rare a good thing as this is, can be obtained without great labour and trauaile. And for mine owne part, will alwaies account thoſe ſorrowes and troubles moſt eaſie and ſweet, be they neuer ſo ſower and vnſufferable, to loue a thing, ſo abſolute and perfect, as your ſweet ſelfe is. For that Generall of an armie, ſhall neuer be taxed with cowardiſe, who hath done his end uour, and (what he can) to cauſe the enemie to come into the field, but he ſhall ſoone be condemned for a daſtard, that ſhall flie from his foe, through very ſeare.</p>
               <p>The honour that one findeth in louing a diuine beautie, eaſilie recompenceth the paines thereof: for that man ſhall be more accounted of, who hath combatted with ſome famous Conquerour, although he be ouercome by him, then he, that ſhall remaine Maiſter of the field, ouer a weake and feeble enemie.</p>
               <p>Thinke not much then (faire and glorious Nymph) if I dare venter to ſerue you, when the meaneſt followers of mightie kings, are more reſpected and regarded, then thoſe that are the greateſt, of other great Lords and Nobles.</p>
               <p>The faire Nymph would haue replied, but that by chance a certaine Virgin came before her, preſenting her with a Sonnet, compoſed in the name of all the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, which hindered her from anſwering me. But this was the Sonnet following.</p>

               <p>I hauing finiſhed theſe two Sonnets, preſented them vnto her, who ſhewed them vnto all her companions, they marking and looking vpon me verie wiſſly, I thinking
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15406:110"/>that by that meanes, I might obtaine ſome of them to be my good friends, and to ſpeake a good word for me, vnto my Miſtris, who now was (once more) conducted by the ſweet voice of the other Nymph vnto the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> where ſhe (for a while) ſtaied. And ſo (deare Father) let me intreate you, that I may make a ſtay here (at this time) for my minde is troubled within me, my tongue faileth, and my voice beginneth to be hoarſe, we wil deferre the reſt til vnto morrow, for what liketh not one day, may chance to pleaſe at an other.</p>
               <p>Content (quoth the old Magitian) and let vs away. The bowe muſt not (alwaies) be bent, leſt it weaken too much, and ſo muſt thou take ſome reſt, or elſe thou wilt be ouer wearie, and ſoone tired. Therefore am I the more willing to yeeld vnto thy requeſt, to the end, thy diſcourſe may be as agreeable vnto thee in reporting, as it is pleaſant vnto me in hearing the ſame. Whereupon they left the place, where, as they were walking homewards, they might perceiue a Shepheard talking with a Shephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe vnder the ſhade of an old Oake, which was the occaſion they drew nigh, to heare what they ſaid, the Shepheard viging her, in this ſort. Fond is that man that thinketh to remoue a huge Rocke, from one place into another, and as fond is he that goeth about to turne, or ſtay the courſe of the ſalt waters of the Sea: Fuen ſo (O cruell <hi>Delia</hi>) is he a foole that will take vpon him to reſiſt the will of the Gods, and oppoſe himſelfe againſt the power of the heauens.</p>
               <p>Thoſe huge Giants the Titans, went about ſuch a bold piece of worke, but being ouerthrowne with lightning, they ſerue as witneſſes, that the hand of the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doth not ſtrike in vaine. If ſo, why then wilt thou ſo wilfully ſtand againſt the decree of the Gods? Which if thou doeſt, thinke not but they will quickly abate thy boldnes, and puniſh thy ouer preſumptuous pride.</p>
               <p>That Maiſter doth puniſh his ſeruant worthily, who ſcoffeth at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and maketh no account to be obedient vnto him. And thinkeſt thou, that the Gods will not plague thee, ſeeing thee ſo ſtubborne againſt their wills, ſo peruerſe againſt their minds, and ſo vnwilling to performe their deſire? They haue ſaued thee, from the rauenous tallents of the murthering Pitate, and as it were (by miracle) brought thee hither, and wherefore doeſt thou thinke they did ſo, but onely becauſe thou ſhouldeſt be milde vnto my prayers, and yeeld gently to graunt me ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour?</p>
               <p>But it ſeemeth by thy carriage hitherto, that thou wilt as it were (of meere obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie) bandie againſt them, in this thine error, but take heede thou be not plagued, and (then too lately, thou wilt wiſh that thou haddeſt changed thy minde, for the Gods vſe alwaies to afflict ſelfewild people, becauſe it is not fit, nor the part of any man, to riſe vp, and to rebell againſt them.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing the moſt maruellous and diuine prouidence, hath brought vs here both together, that they haue aſſiſted thee in this Deſart, and moſt happily haue cauſed thee to meete him (who hath endured ſo much for thy ſake, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence as yet at all) ah chaunge thy humour ſweet <hi>Delia,</hi> alter thy opinion, and ſhew thy ſelfe, to be of another minde, to the end thy ſweetlenitie, and gratious boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, may bring the Gods to be as pleaſing and willing in all thy deſires; as thy vnkind rigor, and harſh diſdaine, haue (heretofore) made them to be auſtere, and angrie towards thee: for miſerable is that wight, and worthie to ſuffer trouble, who being admoniſhed, will not amend, and therefore is out of all hope to finde any ſuccour at all.</p>
               <p>Loue then (froward <hi>Delia</hi>) him who (to obtaine thy grace) hath diſpended ſo many teares, conſumed ſo many whole daies, ſent abroad ſo many ſcalding ſighes, and left ſo many daintie pleaſures, onely to follow thee: and who, if he might but in ſome ſort be aſſured of thy friendſhip, would thinke himſelfe the moſt happieſt and the beſt contented man in the world. But miſerable is he, who ſtill laboureth, and yet findeth himſelfe fruſtrate of the fruits of his labour: yet farre more accurſed is he, who conſumeth his yeares, and his life in the ſeruice of ſuch a proud dame, as yeeldeth no recompence vnto him at all, for that he looſeth his labour and paine, and becauſe he is forced to ſigh and bewaile his fooliſh and vnkind choyſe alone vnto himſelfe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer expecting any remedie.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:15406:111"/>

                  </gap>arted Shepheardeſſs made him this ſower and vnwelcome anſwere. I can neuer belcoue (fond Shepheard) that the Gods, who are the authors of goodnes, and moſt curtenu, Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the Gods (as thou affirmeſt) had brought me hither, to yeeld vnto thy wanton deſires, and to be an attendant vpon this Tyrant Loue, then ſhould they be the authors of my ruine, and the occaſions of my ſinne, but I will neuer thinke ſo vnreuerently or wickedly of their prupent prouidence, and ſacred bountie, and if my good fortune hath made me to eſcape ſo great a daunger (as I confeſſe I haue done) I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanke the Gods therefore, of which ſithence I now finde my ſelfe free, I thinke it no wife dome, to tumble into <hi>Caribdis,</hi> becauſe I haue auoided <hi>Silla,</hi> and hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of one miſchiefe, to fall into another: for I hold my hap more cruell, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnder the bloodie tyrannie of Loue, than if I had bene laid vpon the cruell Altar of <hi>Iuno</hi> (as a Sacrifice) to haue appeaſed her furie.</p>
               <p>Thinke not, that the Gods, take any care of ſuch as they ſuffer to fall into the hands of Loue, but rather, that they account them, for loſt creatures, and ſuch as be moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as the Phiſition giueth ouer a patient, whoſe diſeaſe is deſperate and recureleſſe, when he ſeeth there is hope of his recouerie.</p>
               <p>No man will bring his friend whom he affecteth, vnder the yoke of a Tyrannicall maiſter, who will make his life ouer miſerable, and whoſe crueltie he himſelfe hath felt: now the Gods haue (oftentimes) had experience of this bloodie Loue, and felt his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much rage, furie, and anger, and therefore it is not likely that they will deliuer into ſuch a Butchers hands, that creature which they (moſt of all) deſire to protect, and defend in ſafetie.</p>
               <p>The accident of Loue then, doth not come by the meanes of the Gods; neither are they occaſions of ſuch idlenes in our braines, ſuch Louers being but fooliſh ſo to thinke, who being afflicted with his paſſions, lay all the fault vpon the Gods.</p>
               <p>Who then (anſwered the Shepheard) is the author thereof, and who is it that bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in cur ſoules? &amp; if Loue is ſeared of the Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe lues, how is it poſſiblie but me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be troubled therewithall? and what daintie ſpirit hath there cuer bene, but hath loued? what braue generous minde, or what heroicall and magnanimous heart hath bene without it? As the winde ſerueth for a guide vnto the Sailer in the Sea, guiding his ſhip rightly: Euen ſo, Loue doth ſerue as a <hi>Pilot</hi> vnto the Sonnes of the Gods, to effect and bring to paſſe braue expoites, which can neuer be perfected as they ſhould be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that Loue, ſet foote into the fame. What rare deeds of chiularie did <hi>Hercules</hi> a at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue for faire <hi>Andromacha,</hi> whom he loued? How brauely did <hi>Achilles</hi> carrie himſelfe for <hi>Bxiſeis</hi> ſake, <hi>Iaſon</hi> for <hi>Medea, Theſeus</hi> for <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and <hi>Orlando</hi> for his <hi>Angelica?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Oxe pricked with the gode, beginneth to mend his pace, and draweth more luſtily then at the firſt: and ſo Loue is a kind of pricke, and prouokement, which eggeth forward valiant mindes, forcing them to bring to paſſe, farre more worthie and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſes, then they would haue done, if they had liued quietly at home, without knowing what Loue meant. And therefore, I am of opinion, that not onely men, but the Gods alſo, ought to account themſelues happie, that Loue flouriſheth in them, for it is the bright tosch of their nights, and the ſplendant Sunne of their daies.</p>
               <p>Shepheard, Shepheard (replied the Nymphs) thy owne ſpeech hath confounded thy ſelfe, for if Loue be ſo violentas thou deſcribeſt him, he then cannot laſt, nor make himſelfe knowne to be iuſt. Things violent are alwaies hurtfull vnto ſome one or other, and being ſo full of misfortunes and miſeries, they can neuer abide them, becauſe they paſſe with as great heate and furie as a flaming fire, which conſumeth all that is before it.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:15406:111"/>
               <p>Therefore Loue, being neuer in the meane, but alwayes in the extremitie, cannot chuſe but be very vniuſt, in as much as Iuſtice expelleth all force, without hurting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bodie.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, are there verie fewe, that willingly entertaine it, but as the Tyrant by maine force, and rigorous compulſion, compelleth his ſubiects to do him ſeruice. Euen ſo Loue, through meere violence, maketh men to ſubmit themſelues vnder his yoake, and therefore he cannot be both iuſt and violent all at one time: which two qualities can neuer be at one inſtant, and in one and the ſelfe ſame ſubiect.</p>
               <p>By thine owne confeſſion, he is violent, and therefore he cannot be iuſt, but ought (as one vnworthie) to be reiected and ſhaken off. Nay, I will ſay more, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that maketh a man oftner to offend, and to commit ſinnes, then this Loue doeth, for it picketh out the eyes of Reaſon: In ſuch ſort, as the Louer reſpecteth neither Law, Kinred, Vertue, Grace, nor any Courteſies receiued, ſo he may obtaine his vnrulie deſire, the enioying of which, he reſpecteth more then he doth any Reaſon, Iuſtice, or Honor, whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>For what reſpect I pray you, had <hi>Paris</hi> of his Hoſt <hi>Menelaus? Clytemneſtra,</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon</hi> her husband? and <hi>Tarquine,</hi> of the good name and fame of <hi>Lucretia?</hi> To be ſhort, it is an accurſed kinde of Rage, that breaketh all Alliance and kinred, all Amitie and good friendſhip, Faith, and hoſpitalitie, ouerthrowing topſituruie, all the buildings of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Talke not then vnto mee of this pernitious <hi>LOVE;</hi> The burnt childe, dreads the fire, and I haue ſomewhat felt the flame thereof: and therefore I will reſolue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die, then to be ouertaken by ſo furious an Enemie.</p>
               <p>Ah (faire Shepheardeſſe, replyed the Shepheard) how much art thou deceiued herein? when amongſt all mortall reſpects whatſoeuer, <hi>LOVE</hi> is eſteemed the chiefe, and carryeth away the prize before them all. For what is he that is more warie and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, then the conſtant Louer it towards his Dame? Whom feareth he ſo much to offend, as her? and how willingly would he offer his life to beſacrificed, rather then he would ſo much as once moue or diſpleaſe her? The ſame <hi>LOVE,</hi> being the reaſon, that ſhee alone is not reſpected, but as well all ſuch (of her well-willers) as goe about to aduance and honour her.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that teacheth men better, the Adoration of the Gods, then Loue, for that ſeruice which Louers yeeld vnto their Ladles, hath a kinde of reſemblance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reuerent worſhipping of the Gods: who are not diſpleaſed that wee ſhould attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſuch reſpect vnto ſuch a beautifull thing which they haue made, to the intent it ſhould be honoured.</p>
               <p>For were it not for <hi>LOVE,</hi> what account or difference can there be made betweene an excellent and exquiſite kinde of beautie, and that which is but meane? But that God, that hath taught vs, to diſcerne the faire from the foule, and (eſteeming of the one) to Loue, and refuſe the other: maketh vs to loue and couet faire faces, ſetting on fire thouſands of Inuentions in our ſoules, which reuiueth vs with liuely effects, to the end wee may ſatisfie and content our deſire.</p>
               <p>But (anſwered the Shepheardeſſe) theſe effects are for the moſt part wicked and bad, as are the Childern of a leaude and ill-giuen Father, reſembling the off-spring of ſuch as be crooked, who are borne with crooked backes, as their Parents had before them.</p>
               <p>Now, if ſuch effects are contrarie to Lawe and Reaſon, it were farre better they ſhould be ſtifled as dead, then being ſuffered to liue, they ſhould growe to be miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and vnfortunate. But, if it be neceſſarie, that to driue away all ſmne, wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the ſinner, to the ende, that afterwards it may finde no fit inſtrument to put in practiſe. ſo vngodly a force.</p>
               <p>So, if wee will take away all the bad effects of <hi>LOVE,</hi> wee muſt deſpoyle and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelfe and his enticing allurements alſo.</p>
               <p>For in vaine doth the Gardener goe about to kill or deſtroy any bad and noyſome weede or plant, if without pulling vp the roote, hee doth but onely breake the tender leaues thereof.</p>

               <p>My Ladie is ſarre remote from mee, and therefore remembreth not me: For (as yet) was I neuer regiſtred in the role of her memorie. And (ſay) there ſhould be ſome ſmall draught of mee therein, yet would this cruell abſence quickly deface it. For the bare ſhadowe of a Counterfeit, which the Painter leaueth (without his right colours) vnperfect, can neither be faire, or eſteemed of any price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> forgot her husband when he was abſent: <hi>Hellena</hi> her Spouſe, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other women, all which, through the ſeparation of place, and abſence of their friends, forgot themſelues ſo much, as they (not once) thought of their ancient Louers; For one <hi>Hyper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Heauens graunt I may not haue iuſt cauſe to complaine of this Accident, but that, returning back vnto my diuine <hi>Iulietta.</hi> I may finde her hart, to be gentle and tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, her rigour to be abated, and her ſelfe more milde and affable vnto mee, then ſhe was wont to be: Otherwiſe, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe moſt vnhappie, that the flowing waues of the ſurging Seas, had not (with my inſupportable flames) quenched, and drowned, both my loue, and my life together. For more fearefull is the frowning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Ladie vnto her ſworne Seruant, then the horrible face of the three fatall Siſters vnto a ſicke man: for the one maketh him languiſh, burning in a lingring fire, of thouſand deaths, whereas the other, in a ſmall ſpace, doth ridde him, both of life and paine.</p>

               <p>Thus ſaide the Knight, not a little ioyfull of the anſwere which the late <hi>ECCO</hi> gaue vnto him. But fond is that man that beleeueth in things that are to come, ſeeing they are in the hands of the Almightie, who can change them, making them to take a quite contrie courſe, as ſhall beſt pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>And yet may man (onely) bring his Eſtate, to be eyther Fortunate or miſetable. Fortunate, in being penitent for his defaults, appeaſing the wrath of God, through his true repentance: who being mercifull vnto him, ſendeth him Celeſtiall <hi>Manda</hi> downe from heauen. And miſerable, in prouoking his heanie anger againſt him, whereby hee withdraweth his grace, without giuing him that good which hee promiſed him, and which he hoped for, becauſe heirs vnworthy of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were depriued of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> (although God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it vnto them before) by reaſon of their ſinnes: their wickedneſſe oppoſing it ſelfe againſt his diuine force and helpe, and his heauenlie bountie beeing turned from them, in that they did ſo grieuouſly offend him.</p>
               <p>Let no perſon therefore aſſure himſelfe (through others reports) to taſte of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, or to feele of vnhappineſſe heereaſter to comes but rather diſpoſe himſelfe to liue well and godlie, to the end hee may enioy a bleſſed life, without feeling anie form of cuill.</p>

               <p>So manie are the humours, that <hi>Hope</hi> is bound to content, as it is impoſſible for her to ſtay long in anie one place, they thinking to haue a great pleaſure, by enioying of her, when indeed it is the greateſt plague that can be. For hee that is poſſeſſed with her but one noure, is puniſhed (at the leaſt) ten dayes after for the ſame. By reaſon the apprehenſion of anie bad newes is ſo cruell, as it drowneth and killeth all hope of contentment to come hereafter: Enery one feeling the chaunces of griefe, ſarre more ſharpe and bitter, then the Accidents or occurrences of ioy can be ſweete or comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any way.</p>

               <p>This Nymph was <hi>Orithia,</hi> (amorots of <hi>Areas</hi>) who after ſhe had ſent forth many ſcalding ſighs, ſpake thus vnto the Shepheard. Whut hope remaineth for that vaſſaſſe (who haue taken vp armes againſt his lawfull Prince, and done him thouſands of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in ſpoyling of his countrie) to looke for ſuccour at his hands, when he ſhall fall into miſerie.</p>
               <p>The law of Iuſtice, permits to oppoſe force to force, to ſuffer wrong, againſt iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to repulſe violence with all the furie that thay be; Neither is he blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, who rightly puniſheth ſuch iniuries as he hath wrongfull receiued: Inaſmuch, as Iuſtice commandeth that he that doeth ill, muſt receiue reward according vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is a hard matter, to obtaine ſuccour from our enemie, although <hi>Coriolanus</hi> had that good fortune, and that ſumous <hi>Aihenian Themistocles,</hi> long before him, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the iniuries that are paſt, and thoſe outrages which we haue receiued, doth bandie and ſet it ſelfe againſt the good will, which (perhaps) we might finde in our need.</p>
               <p>And ſurely they had neede to be borne vnder a moſt fortunate Plannet, to be moſt excellent and worthie men of deſert, that dare venture to lend their helping hand vnto their aduerſaries, being in a maner halfe dead: yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> did it, although too late it repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him thereof: for he through ſauing of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> loſt through their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull hands, both the Empire and his life. Malicious hatred being (once) deeplie rooted in the breſt, is a poyſon ſo violent and ſtrong, as it can hardly (but with great paine) be driuen out of the hart of man yea (doe the beſt you can) for your life, yet will there ſome ſmall ſparleles thereof ſtill remaine couo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides theſe little ſparkles will carch hold on fire, vpon the firſt and leaſt occaſion that may be; making oftentimes a greater flame, then there was before. If then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, hindereth our enemie from doing good vnto vs, what hope may poore wilde
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15406:114"/>worldlings haue, to find reliefe from the heauens, the worſt aduerſarie they haue. For if the faults and iniuries, or the wrongs and abuſes, that one offereth vnto another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to be at deadly hate, what friendſhip may we looke for from the heauens, whom we ſo often haue ſo grieuouſly offended? It is an ordinarie courſe here amongſt vs, to tranſgreſſe the commandements giuen vnto vs from aboue, to tread vnder our feete their ordinances, and to ieſt and ſcoffe at their might and power, which if it be ſo, are they then bound to aſſiſt vs, when we are in want? He that will ſeeke, to obtaine the good will of any man of worth, ſeeketh how to obey and pleaſe him in what he can, ſtudying to applie his will vnto his minde, and to condeſcend vnto whatſoeuer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall command. For of the agreement in manners, is friendſhip engendred: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we take a quire contrarie faſhion, ſhewing all the ſignes and tokens we can, of ill will vnto the heauens, whereby they haue reaſon the more to deteſt vs.</p>
               <p>But you (perhaps) will replie and ſay, that the heauens are puiſſantand Diuine, and therfore if they pleaſe they many helpe vs. But to this I anſwere, that therfore we are the more to be blamed, becauſe that fault that one committeth againſt a great Monarch or King, is more ſeuerely to be chaſtiſed, then that of a poore priuate perſon: and he is more to be puniſhed, that doth iniurie vnto a wiſe, graue, and vpright man, than if he had done it vnto one that was wicked, cruell, and vniuſt.</p>
               <p>The powers aboue then being puiſſant, may make our fault to be the more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, in that we dare preſume to offend them, and they being Diuine, our finnes are leſſe ſubiect to pardon, becauſe we ſeeke to iniure them, who are ſo ſacred and iuſt. But of all ſuch miſerable wretches as appeale vnto the aide of the heauens, I know none, whom they are leſſe bound to helpe, then ſuch as (we call) Louers. For their vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenes, commeth not from aboue, they are not the cauſe thereof, neither are they theſe which powre downe vpon their heads this cuill (as oftentimes they doe, warre, Famine, &amp; Peſtilence, theſe being the ordinarie whippes, with which they ſcourge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their impieties) but it is themſelues that are cauſes of their owne ſorrowes, becauſe they driue away ſage Reaſon from them, who is of might ſufficient, to deliuer and ſet them free.</p>
               <p>The franticke Bedlem that wilfully killeth himſelfe, can he, dying, accuſe any other of his diſaſter, or complaine of a ſtraunger, when he hath murthered himſelfe? No more can a fond Louer, hurting himſelfe, be angrie with the heauens, who was not the cauſe thereof, but he himſelfe. And herein, they reſemble little children, that hauing done a fault, lay the blame thereof, either vpon their play-fellowes, or vpon ſomething elſe, being neuer willing to confeſſe that they haue done amiſſe. Fuen ſo, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hauing felt one burning in their breſts, the furious fire, which in the end conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and deſtroy eth them, condemne the powers aboue for the ſame.</p>
               <p>But ſmall reaſon haue they ſo to doe, for they that vſe it, are rather counted to be full of rage, and giuen to murmure, then eſteemed as wiſe and prudent perſons. And yet I cannot denie, but that the heauens narurally, doe (as it were) ſeeme to be bound to doe vs good, but the accident oftentimes corrupteth the Nature.</p>
               <p>The Parent by Nature is bound to loue his child, yet, if his his owne fleſh, ſhall be peruerſe, and ill giuen, becomming a mortall enemie vnto his Father, this right of Nature ceaſeth, and he is no more bound to doe any thing for him, no more than for a ſtraunger.</p>
               <p>There is a iuſt law grounded vpon this reaſon, which permitteth the Father being iuſtly offended with his Sonne, to diſhinherit him of his lands; this being the very ſame puniſhment that the children of <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſuffered, for that they moſt maliciouſly accuſed their Father to dote for age, and to be out of his right wits, onely becauſe they would haue depriued him of his poſſeſſions and goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> likewiſe, ſtucke not to proſecute the death of his too forward ſonne, moſt cruellie, and with great diſgrace alſo, becauſe he had done, as well againſt the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as contrarie vnto his owne command.</p>
               <p>So therefore, although the heauens (I ſpeake all this againſt my ſelfe as well as thee) <hi>Coribant,</hi> for that I am as wretched a Louer as thy ſelfe art (in euerie degree) be our common Father, and for that cauſe is naturally bound to doe vs good, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15406:115"/>is he not bound to ſhewe vs this kindneſſe, if we ſhall gricuouſly and willingly offend him: as the Accidence of the offence ſhall be more violent and ſtrong, then the naturall Right is, which by reaſon of this, quite ouerthroweth the other. For as water quencheth the fire, and maketh it cold as any Ice, which by nature is hote, burning, and full of heate. So the diſcourteſies and iniuries, which we offer vnto ſuch as by Nature were prouided to be our protectors and defenders, drowne and extinguiſh all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire and Right, altering their good mindes from vs, quite contrarie vnto that it was at the firſt.</p>
               <p>A man that is by kinde borne vicious and bad, and ſuch a one as bringeth forth of the wombe of his mother, wickedneſſe with him into the worlde, may <hi>(per Accidence)</hi> through (good education, and bringing vp) become vertuous and wiſe. Euenſo, the Accident of iniuries and diſpleaſures, may chaunge and alter the curteous inclination of a kinde friend, ſowring and ſharpning the ſame againſt vs, as the Lees and dregs doe the ſweeteſt wine. And this miſchiefe falling vpon our heads, wee cannot condemne anie for it, but our owne ſelues, who are the chiefe and efficient cauſe thereof. And therefore we are much in the wrong, to lay the blame on him, whom through our owne meere follie we haue made him our ſoe, although he be ſlow and ſlacke to helpe vs, we being falne into miſerie, although before he by nature, was bound to lend vnto vs his helping hand, and to aſſiſt vs, in what he could certainely, if we were well and godly giuen, and without prouoking or tempting the Eternall Power aboue: would we, but confirme our ſelues in all our actions, according vnto his deſire, keeping vs with the bonds of his commandements; there is no doubt, but he would aide vs, hearing vs when we ſhould call vnto him, and would nor ſticke to raine downe <hi>Manna</hi> (as he did) for the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nouriſhing vs in the wildeſt Deſarts that be.</p>
               <p>But what law can force or conſtraine him to ſhew vs this mercie, when we ſhew our ſelues to be his mortall enemies, going about to increaſe his wrath euerie houre againſt vs. But ſay that he were willing and readie (as we are moſt vnworthie thereof) to helpe vs, and that it would pleaſe him, to haue this pittifull and fauourable regard ouer vs, yet may you be well aſſured, he would neuer take any charge, nor euer make any account of Louers; for their griefes is not numbred amongſt the plagues of other miſcrable creatures (the ſecond cauſe whereof the heauens oftentimes are, our ſinnes being the firſt) Loue being ſeene to be but a verie meere follie, and therefore neuer moueth the heauens with compaſſion to heale them.</p>
               <p>A great and groſe error therefore it is amongſt Louers, to imagine that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens are the Authors of their paine, but a farre greater fault is it in them, to require their aide and aſſiſtance: for Loue is not any kind of contagious diſeaſe, cauſing men to die, cutting off one after another, and for that cauſe, hath reaſon to implore the heauens for aide to helpe them (as they doe when any great mortalitie or plague rageth amongſt them: but it is a ſickenes, that continueth ſtill without dying, with which onely ſenſuall perſons and ſooles (and none elſe) are infected.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon, that we haue neuer knowne any Louers, to haue bene cured through miracle, whereas we find written in diuers learned bookes, that the bodies of many men, being dead, haue bene reſtored to life againe, and that many haue bene cured of incurable diſcaſes, onely this vaine ſicknes is vnworthie of remedie and reliefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceedeth not, neither through the anger of the heauens, nor by reaſon of the contagion of other diſeaſes, but onely through our owne fooliſhnes.</p>
               <p>Now as that amitie cannot be firme and ſtrong betweene man and woman, where they anſwere not one another in deſires and affection (although naturally they are bound to loue one another) euen ſo, the heauens cannot be accuſed of crueltie, in not ſcourging mortall creatures, if the cauſe which ſhould drawe them vnto this charitable endeuour, be taken away from them.</p>
               <p>Let vs then no more exclaime againſt the Celeſtiall Power aboue, but let vs thanke our owne ſelues that we deſerue no better of him, our ſinnes being the cauſe, he giueth vs ouer. As the fellon cannot blame the Iudge that condemneth him to death, nor accuſe him of ouermuch ſeueritie, in that he dieth, but rather his owne bad liuing that brought him vnto ſo vntimely an end; for he is not to be thought ill of, who doth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15406:115"/>rightly diſcharge his office, wherein he is placed, following the line of Iuſtice in all his proceedings, though neuer ſomuch diſcommoditie happen thereby vnto the wicked; becauſe it is a vertue to puniſh vice, and not any Tyrannie, what puniſhment ſoeuer is afflicted vpon thoſe that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Neuer trouble thy ſelfe then to crie vnto the heauens, to aſſiſt thee in thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; for they are deafe at the praiers of Louers, and are not obliged, to require and make whole that ſore, which we (through our owne fooliſhnes) haue made to corrupt our owne bodies.

               <p>The Nymph hauing made an end of her drearie ſong, began to ſpeake a freſh in this ſort. I aſſure thee (Shepheard) though I ſing, yet doe I take ſmall pleaſure in the ſame, for my note is like the tune of that ſnowy Bird which ſingeth in the Riuer <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>

That Cannon burſteth, into which powder is put, if there be no void place, through which the fire may iſſue forth.</p>
               <p>There is not a heart, be it neuer ſo couragious, but the paine of Loue will make it to bend and breake, vnleſſe it eaſe it ſelfe with ſobbing and weeping: and yet alas, theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are but as worthleſſe Plaiſters of ſubtill Chyrurgians, who to keepe the wound the longer from healing (to the end they may gaine the more of the Patient) winne time (ſtill) by laying ſuch ſalues vnto it, as rather make it worſe then better. For to ſpeake truth indeed, Loue paſſeth not away through length of time, weareth not away with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, nor is ſatisfied, though we lament and ſorrow neuer ſo much. He is more proud and fierce, more ſtubborne and hard, than the Rocke, that is made hollow with the often droppings of water. And to giue you a ſufficient teſtimome of the ſame, beſides that I my ſelfe haue had experience thereof, I will report vnto you a ſtrange Hiſtorie, in which, you ſhall haue a taſt, of millions of cruelties that he did committ, bringing his louing flaues to their vtter ouerthrow in the end.</p>
               <p>But what? did I ſay I would diſplay Loue in his colours? Alacke it is impoſſible, for I my ſelfe am not able to report the leaſt part of mine owne griefes, not much vnlike vnto the principall Actors of my Tragedie. But it is all one, I muſt, and will report it. Examples that are gone and paſt, teach vs (that come after) how to liue well, and beate plaine the way, which leadeth vs, either vnto blacke infamie, or elſe vnto immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; beſides, the times with ſuch chaunces as they bring forth, are found (often) to be like, and agreeable in effects. Harken therefore, for now I begin my Tale.</p>
               <p>It is a comman ſpeech (almoſt of euery one) that beautie, ought to be accounted, as an ineſtimable Iewell, be ſtowed vpon vs, by the Gods, whom (as it is thought) it doth reſemble, they themſelues, hauing vouchſafed to honour it (here) vpon the earth, to the end, that men, adoring the ſame, may (the better) learne how to worſhip them aright. For one would thinke, it were impoſſible to encounter or meete with anything, more excellent, or, that is of more power to commandouer the hearts of mortall men. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, I am of a contrarie conceit, being of opinion, that beautie ought rather to be chriſtened by the name of the Fountaine, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſprang forth (in great aboundance) all the misfortunes, and calamities, that happen in this world. For the more beautifull a thing is, the more it is deſired, this deſire ingendring in the minde of man, a thouſand deuiſes, either, cruell, vnhoneſt; or vnreaſonable to obtaine the ſame, and to carrie it away, becauſe, to purchaſe what one doth couetor like, a man carrth not (often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) to infringe and breake, the barres of Iuſtice, Honour, and of Lawe, imagining that the accompliſhment of all things, lieth in the effecting of his deſire. So as, I am not of their mindes, who place beautie aboue all other mortall things, but rather iudge it, to be more pernitious vnto men then Serpents, whom they loathe and flie from, as from their deadly enemies.</p>
               <p>This beantie ſerueth for a Subiect and matter where vpon Loue may worke the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to exerciſe his moſt vnlawfull and tyrannicall effects, in as much as (without him) he could haue nothing whereupon he might be working.

               <p>But not to digreſſe from our firſt matter. Not farre from this gallant <hi>Lombard,</hi> called <hi>Leander,</hi> was there an other faire place, the owner whereof, was a neighbour of his, a youthfull Gentleman, a Batcheler, and vnmarried; which two, what by reaſon of the neareneſſe of their houſes, and the conformitie of their manners, grewe to be ſo inward and deare friendes, as they could not abide one to be from another; and their loue was ſo great, as all things (as farre as honor would permit) was common betweene them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilades</hi> was neuer ſo great with <hi>Oreſtes, Theſeus</hi> neuer nearer to <hi>Peritheus,</hi> nor <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> neuer more beloued of <hi>Epheſtion:</hi> then <hi>Leanaer</hi> was of his friend, and his friend of him.</p>
               <p>Neuer went they on Hawking, Hunting, or anie other ſuch like laudable exerciſe, but they were together: Being at home, they had but one boord, and being abroad, but one bed, and one purſe betweene them: as if they had beneſworne brethren, and both borne of one mother. But now marke the difference betweene leaud Loue, and loyall Amitie.</p>
               <p>This friendſhip betwixt theſe two young neighbours, ſo ſacred, ſo religious, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, was famous euerie where, and commended throughout all the whole Countrey there about: which neuer theleſſe, cruell <hi>LOVE</hi> diuided and brake in ſunder. Yea, and in ſuch ſort, as that which was the chiefe ioy and contentment of them both, coſt them both their liues.</p>
               <p>By this then, may we perceiue how contrarie <hi>LOVE</hi> is vnto Friendſhip: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the one is laudable, honeſt, praiſe-worthie, and profitable, the other is wicked, and cruell, ſowing diſcord and malice, (amongſt ſuch as were, and ſhould bee) moſt faithfull and firme friendes, one vnto an other.</p>
               <p>So did <hi>LOVE</hi> drowne and extinguiſh (long ſince) all reſpect, friendſhip, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which <hi>Medea</hi> ought vnto her Father, bereauing her of all naturall pittie, tearing in peeces her owne proper Brother, to ſuccour and helpe her Louer <hi>Iaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe this miſchieuous <hi>LOVE,</hi> forced the daughter of <hi>Minos,</hi> to be his mortall enemie, onely to follow her deceitfull ſeruant <hi>Theſeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither did this wicked <hi>LOVE</hi> worke a leſſe villanie againſt theſe two friendes: for <hi>Leander,</hi> hauing (as I ſaid before) a moſt excellent, faire, and modeſt wife, but (as <hi>Hellena,</hi> vnfortunate) was the occaſion that ſhee miniſtred meanes and matter vnto <hi>LOVE,</hi> to put in practiſe, and to exerciſe ſo manie cruell and vniuſt parts, (as hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did) but if the Innocent merit to be excuſed, then is ſhee not to be accuſed, as the loſſe of her owne deare life afterwards ſhewed.</p>
               <p>But what? kingdomes (oftentimes) which of themſelues are rich and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſet a fire, moſt hurtfull, damageable, and ſpoyling warres, of which notwithſtanding,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:15406:117"/>they are manie times cleare of) crauing no other thing, then onely to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the dominion and gouernement of the right and lawfull heire vnto the Crowne.</p>
               <p>But the ambitious deſires of men are they that make the wounds, by reaſon of the greedineſſe they haue to enioy that, which in their conceits, they iudge to be faire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and pleaſant.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, the friend of <hi>Leander,</hi> called <hi>Antonio Picchio,</hi> made account of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unders</hi> houſe as his owne, being ſeldome or neuer from thence, and the longer hee ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (there) the better he was welcome, his marryed friend, and his wife (for his ſake) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him the beſt entertainment they could deuiſe.</p>
               <p>It is an olde ſaid ſawe, that a man alwayes liketh his neighbours houſe, better than his owne. Whether it be the chaunging of lodgings is the cauſe, or the ſtraunge and good companie that he findeth,<note place="margin">An old ſaying.</note> where there is good refort and merrie.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt our Batcheller paſſed his time moſt pleaſantly away, hee began inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to caſt an affection vnto his friends wife, and to loue her farre better then hee did her husband.</p>
               <p>And thus are many men now a dayes made account of, onely for their wiues ſakes: as manie kiſſe the children, onely for the Nurſes ſake.</p>

               <p>So long he beganne to like her, that at laſt he was troubled in his minde, ſo as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceit ranne ſtill in his braine, a nouell flame was kindled in his breſt, and a new ſtrange deſire chaunged the nature of his firſt humor: And in ſo much as within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after, he became another kinde of man then he had bene heretofore.</p>
               <p>I will (now) maruell no more, why the Poets haue ſet downe ſo manie humane bodies to be chaunged (through <hi>LOVE</hi>) into diuers inſenſible and ſenſleſſe likenes, and ſhipes. For there is no doubt, but that the very countenance, the conditions, and the deſires of Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers alter and chaunge, in ſo much as they turne themſelues into new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (as the Snake doth caſt her skinne) by reaſon this extreame hote and ſupernaturall paſſion, comming vppon the ſuddaine) and croſſing the right nature of man; breaketh and chaſeth it ſoone away, as a ſuddaine flood of water, carryeth before him, both hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Trees, and houſes, and whatſoeuer elſe withſtandeth his violence.</p>
               <p>And ſo did it happen vnto fooliſh <hi>Antonio Picchio:</hi> The deſire he had to ſee his ſhee friend, and chaſe the Deare with her husband, was the occaſion he came oftner to <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> houſe,<note place="margin">Louers meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed and changed.</note> then (otherwiſe) he would haue done: for he was paſſing craftie, and knewe too too well, how to colour his comming thither, Loue being his Schoole-maſter, and hauing taught him this cunning.</p>
               <p>Louers neuer want a pretext or ſhadow to cloake theit affections. It is the firſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they learne in <hi>Cupids</hi> ſchoole, and which they ſtudie carneſtly to obſerue, to the end (that for want of concealing that,<note place="margin">The firſt leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learneth.</note> which they are moſt deſirous ſhould be hid from the ſight of others) they feare it it ſhould be afterwards diſcouered, and appeare in his right forme and likenes.</p>
               <p>The eyes of his Miſtris onely ſeemed in his iudgement, worthie to be marked and regarded, although they reſembled the Viper, which as well hurteth as helpeth a man: for no ſooner did he gaze vppon them, but that his ſoule ſwallowed downe a ſweet poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous potion, feeling at one inſtant both pleaſure and paine, yet could not hee liue, without approching neare this ardent Fire. Although the nearer hee came vnto it, the more (by degrees, hee conſumingly) both melted and waſted away.</p>

               <p>Wherein he reſembleth that ſicke patient, who doth nothing elſe but drinke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath drunke, findeth the drinke to double his griefe, thoughout his bodie.</p>
               <p>Had he had but the libertie of ſpeech, and might he haue bene bolde to haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his minde, hee had not endured halfe the torments he did, but being preuented by vnhoneſt meanes, and becauſe hee was vnworthie to receiue anie ſuccour or helpe, hee was forced (though much againſt his will) to be ſilent, and to hold his peace; For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch talke (oftentimes) doubleth a mans ſhame, and hindereth him not a little. His aime, was at the marke, which onely appertained to his Friend.</p>
               <p>And like as the Theefe feareth to deliuer his minde vnto the Iudge, becauſe of the great deſire he hath to commit ſome one Robberie or other: Fuen ſo, a Louer (being in his conceits diſhoneſt, and quite repugnant to Honour, dareth not but conceale the ſame, as much as hee may, to auoyd greater diſgraces that may enſue, for feare of further danger.</p>
               <p>This was the cauſe that the ſonne of <hi>Seleucus</hi> louing his Stepmother ouer dearely, (becauſe he kept his mouth ſo cloſe, his lippes being ſealed with the Signet of dutifull reſpect and lawfull Honour) endured great torment, lying at the point of death.</p>
               <p>The hart of man being tainted with poyſon, dyeth ſoone, vnleſſe by ſome meanes or other, the venome be caſt forth; and therefore moſt inſupportable is their anguiſh and tortures, who dare not diſcouer their hurts, becauſe they are vnworthie of helpe. But what?</p>

               <p>And ſo did <hi>Picchio,</hi> onely his heauie eye, and ſadde countenance, ſupplied the office of his tongue, by which he declared his minde by ſighes, though otherwiſe hee durſt not. And therefore, it is a hard matter for thoſe that loue conſtantly, to conceale their paſſions, doe they neuer ſet ſo hard and cloſe a Bridle before their tongue; for either the pale colour of their face, either their ſad and heauie countenance,<note place="margin">A Louer can hardly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yea, and ſometimes a flame too.</p>
               <p>This then, was the occaſion, that <hi>Antonio</hi> was chaunged both in fauour and ſhape, and yet notwithſtanding, theſe were not ſufficient ſtrong teſtimonies, for the ſtanders by, to iudge that he was in Loue.</p>
               <p>Seldome or neuer is the Criminall condemned to die vppon bare ſuppoſitions or likely hoodes; if neither his owne eyes, haue giuen anie ſhrewde geſſe, or his owne tongue diſcouered his offence. And yet this alteration of bodie in <hi>Picchio,</hi> made euery one to wonder, in ſo much as they were maruellouſly deſirous to know the reaſon thereof; for the nature of man is alwayes verie cur lous, to heare of ſtraunge matters, delighting in nouelties, and to vnderſtand the ſeuerall euents, and occaſions of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But to what ende ſhould the Phyſition enquire of a ſicke man, the originall of his diſcaſe, what it is, and how it came; if the patient be ſtedfaſtly reſolued to die, and will not liue?</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, it was but loſt labour, for thoſe who did importune verie often poore <hi>Picchio,</hi> to diſcouer where his moſt paine lay, when he meant not to tell them. For he had bene worthie to haue bene regiſtred for a right Dolt indeed, if he ſhould haue made them acquainted therewith, when they could doe him no good at all, and who were ſo farre from helping of him, as they ſooner would haue brought poyſon then Balme, for his recureleſſe wound.</p>
               <p>O Tyraunous <hi>LOVE,</hi> thou art not content alone, to inflict vpon vs manie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſiues and dolours, vnleſſe thou forceſt vs alſo to commit manie villainous Actions,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15406:118"/>making vs thy executioners, by doing of which, wee looſe our whole contentments, our honours, and our liues.</p>
               <p>Was not the anguiſh and agonie that hapleſſe <hi>Antonio</hi> endured, ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee? but that he muſt needes perpetrate ſo hainous a deed, as muſt coſt him the life of her, whom hee ſo dearely loued; muſt cauſe her husband to die, and make him to ſpill his owne heart blood, and all to ſatisfie thee?</p>
               <p>But it is a thing vſuall and ordinarie, to ſee in thy Theater, thouſands of Tragedies, of all ſorts of murthers, horrible Treaſons, and moſt damned villanies, preſented vpon the Stage before thee.</p>
               <p>It is not (as thou thinkeſt) enough to haue life of one onely, (as thoſe cruell Gods vſed to doe, (who demaunded men to be ſacrificed vnto them) but thou wilt haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to appeaſe thy wrath, that thou mayeſt be (as it were) drunke with their blood, and grow fatte with eating and feeding vppon their fleſh.</p>
               <p>But to come to kinde <hi>Leander,</hi> who ſeeing <hi>Picchio</hi> in this heauie taking, began to condole wonderfullie with him for his ſickneſſe, and as it were, to participate, and beare parcell of his paine, crying out for the ſorrowes of his friend. But that which grieued him moſt of all, was, becauſe hee could not learne of <hi>Antonio,</hi> what the cauſe of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment ſhould be, taking it paſſing vnkindely at his hands, that hee would neuer tell him. But, had hee but knowne the minde of him, hee had cut off manie wofull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences which after followed.</p>
               <p>But alas, Men haue not windowes in their bodies, that we may ſee into their harts, and onely God aboue knoweth the ſecret thoughts of euerie one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priam</hi> thought that he had broke aſunder the fatall threed of the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> commaunding that <hi>Paris</hi> (his owne ſonne) ſhould be caſt amongſt wolues, to be deuoured of them.</p>
               <p>And yet (good man) he could not. <hi>Danaus</hi> cauſing his owne daughters, cut their husbands throats, came for all this vnto that luckleſſe ende, which the Oracles of the Gods, had fore-told him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtiages</hi> ſought to murther, and to make away <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and neuertheleſſe, he dyed a wretched death, as was before allotted vnto him.</p>
               <p>Oft may Deſtinie be foreſeene, but (neuer) can it be preuented: for what the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens decree againſt mortall men, that ſhall happen vnto them; let them ſeeke neuer ſo much to preuent it. <hi>Leander</hi> was ordained before his byrth to haue this hard happe, neither could his good Fortunes hinder it: had hee ſought neuer ſo much to auoyde the ſame.</p>
               <q>

               <p>The <hi>Titans,</hi> thoſe monſtrous Gyants, were blaſted with Lightning, and tumbled downe headlong into hell, becauſe they would peſume to encounter with the Gods: And <hi>Tamirus</hi> and <hi>Marſius,</hi> the one loſt his eyes, and the other his skinne, becauſe they dared to compare with <hi>Apollo,</hi> and his ſacred Siſters. But neuer theleſſe, to beginne where wee left.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Leander</hi> often intreated, ſollicited, yea, and Coniured <hi>Antonio,</hi> to make manifeſt the cauſe of his ſicknes vnto him, yet could hee not ſo much as get one word from him, which made him ſo much the more diſconſolate.</p>
               <p>And yet to ſay the truth, who would haue done, but as <hi>Antonio</hi> did, beeing in his caſe? For to haue diſcouered the truth thereof vnto him, had bene as if a guilty wretch ſhould haue confeſſed his criminall miſdeeds before the Iudge, and to put himſelfe into the hands of his vtter enemie, hauing iuſt cauſe to be reuenged of him.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace <hi>Leander</hi> (after his olde wont) taketh on, and lamenteth, that he hath not that kinde intereſt in his friend, as (before) hee thought he had had: Crying out that hee loueth him not. For otherwiſe, hee would not let to haue diſcloſed a greater
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15406:118"/>matter then that vnto him.</p>
               <p>For (ſaide he, weeping) vnto <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o,</hi> Perſwade thy ſelfe (deare friend) that I will ſpend my heart blood to doe thee good, and neither ſhall any meanes be left vnſought for, to helpe thee, ſo I may but onely knowe the cauſe of thy maladie. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy well-fare is mine, thy ſickneſſe, my ſorrow, and that as long as thou art ill, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well at eaſe.</p>
               <p>Why then (thou that art the ſweeteſt part of mine owne ſelfe) ſhouldeſt thou thus deferre to reueale thy diſcontentment vnto him, who is thine owne ſworne brother? and who cannot be content, as long as thou art thus diſpleaſed? Now (good now) doe not delay any longer, but let me know thy minde, ſince I am grieued as much as thy ſelfe, to ſee thee in this moſt grieuous taking.</p>
               <p>Truely, truely, if you doe keepe this ſtill (thus from me) I cannot chuſe but thinke, you are no perfect, nor true friend indeede: for no fortune bad or good, ought to part ſuch as knit in true frienſhip, and loyall affections bands, and they ought to be partners, as well of weale as of woe.</p>
               <p>Then why ſhouldeſt thou doubt me, or be thus ſtrange vnto me? haue you ſeene or marked any thing in me, that might make thee conceit mee, not to be the ſame man towards thee, that I haue bene of yore? Or doe you imagine, that I am not as willing to take part of your bad fortunes, as in former time I haue bene, to be acquainted with your good? If you thinke ſo hardly of mee, I proteſt you doe me the greateſt wrong that may be.</p>
               <p>No, no: one friend muſt not conceiue ſiniſterly of another, neither miſtruſt him, without vehement and moſt apparant preſumptions, but muſt alwayes iudge the beſt, rather then imagine the worſt, no more then one ought to condemne him that is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and honeſt, vnleſſe there be apparent proofe and reſtimony againſt him of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The affection that is betweene two friends, is ſo ſacred and religious of it ſelfe, that there is no ſenſe, why any ſhould take exceptions againſt it, as long as it ſheweth no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie effects, but ſuch as be worthy of all commendation and praiſe.</p>
               <p>If thou thinkeſt, that to recouer thy health, or to purchaſe ſome comfort for thee, it lyeth in my power, and that I haue that which may doe thee good, then haſt thou the more reaſon to demaund it freely: For rightly may hee be counted but a counterfeit friend, that will not employ the vttermoſt of his power, to helpe his friend, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that true friends indeed, reioyce, and are not a little proude, when there is any occaſion giuen them to engage themſelues, or what they haue, for to profite one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>For as a learned Scholler deſireth nothing more, then that his learning may be knowen abroade in the world: ſo a ſure friend, doth not couet for any thing ſo much, as to render ſome aſſured teſtimonie of his infallible friendſhip, vnto his beſt beloued friend.</p>
               <p>Then doe not ſmoother this thy griefe within thy ſelfe, but make me acquainted therewithall: Otherwiſe, thou wilt induce me to haue this opinion of thee, either that thou doeſt hold me for thine enemie, or elſe, that thou art no right friend vnto me, and therefore, iudge of me by thine owne ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Although theſe ſpeeches were vttered with great earneſtnes, and with a moſt hartie affection, yet could they not worke any thing at all in the minde of <hi>Antonio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the wilde Boare, ſitting vppon his tayle, ſtandeth ſtoutly in his owne defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dogges, not ſtirring once, as much as one foote, from his firſt place, now tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Brache, and then ſhaking in pieces another: euen ſo <hi>Antonio</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Coneealeth ſtill (within his breſt) his paine</l>
                     <l>Nor, (but to Mistris his) will tell the ſame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But the meanes how to diſcouer it vnto her, he knoweth not: much leſſe, how to finde occaſion to breake his minde vnto her.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:15406:119"/>
               <p>O how hard a matter is it to doe ill, and when wee haue done it, to conceale the ſame? whereas the behauiour and carriage of the well-meaning man is ſafe and ſure, not vnlike a common beaten way, that is eaſie to be found.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Leander</hi> looketh for an anſwere of <hi>Antonio,</hi> who could not chuſe, but that he muſt needs anſwere him, and anſwer him he did: but (God knoweth) in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with ſuch ſimple and bare excuſes, as <hi>Leander</hi> perceiued too plainely, that the young Louer meant not to acquaint him with that which troubled him ſo much: which was the reaſon that for that time, hee gaue ouer to importune him any more, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that his conſcience told him, hee had done what he could, to the vttermoſt of his power, as much as did belong vnto him.</p>
               <p>For, when one hath offered vnto his deare and beloued friend, (as much as in him lyeth, to hinder, or croſſe and keepe backe ſome inconuenience that is like to happen vnto him) although he cannot bring what he would to paſſe: yet is it farre leſſe griefe vnto him, then if the pretended miſchiefe had come, and he had offered no kindneſſe at all vnto him: becauſe we beeing mortall creatures, are not able to cope with the Gods, whoſe wills it is, it ſhould be ſo, and to be ouercome by them, (after we haue done to the vttermoſt of our ſtrength and power) is not a cauſe why wee ſhould chafe or ſtomacke thereat; in as much as wee are ſubiect vnto them, and the rather, becauſe we are made and formed by them.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Antonio</hi> his diſcaſe increaſeth (daylie) more and more, hee taketh no reſt, nor can he eate or drinke, his colour is earthly, and his face is pale and leane. The day he ſpendeth in ſighing, and the night in ſobbing, whilſt his eyes looke redde, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall weeping. (For though teares be forbidden braue and gallant Spirits) yet are they tollerable in them, when they chaunce to fall into the amorous and ardent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Loue. His armes are brawne-fallen, and on his bodie appeareth little or no fleſh at all, in ſuch ſort, as he reſembleth an <hi>Anatomie,</hi> or dead carkaſſe, rather then a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man.</p>
               <p>As hee that is plagued with a hote burning Feuer, giueth manie teſtimonies of the ſame. One while, by ſuddaine ſhaking and ſhiuering, throughout his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, another while, by a colde ſweat, and then by a hote one againe. Euen ſo, <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> his in firmitie appeared by many ſignes, there beeing not one ioynt or member of his coarſe, but what ſhewed him to be extreamely tormented, and as it were, at deaths doore.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Leander</hi> ſeeing, began to be halfe madde, for the very anguiſh thereof: what to doe he knew not, and therefore was almoſt at his wittes ende. To ſet vppon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, to ſee if he could perſwade him to ſhriue himſelfe vnto him; he thought were but follic, by reaſon, he found him (before) ſo vnwilling to participate vnto him, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any thing.</p>
               <p>At the laſt he began to thinke, that although he kept it from him (perhaps vpon ſome ſecret occaſion) yet peraduenture, another might wring it out of him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, he went vnto his wife, praying her to take the paines to ſee, if ſhee could learne of <hi>Antonio,</hi> that which hee had ſpent ſo much labour to knowe, and yet by no meanes could attaine there vnto.</p>
               <p>The chaſte Ladie, who was wonderfull willing to obey her husband, and who affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (yet with modeſtie) what her Lord liked, being of her owne diſpoſition, ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and pittifull, as ſhe gricued for the hurt of an other: eſpecially he being the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friend her husband had, gladly accepted of the proffer. Promiſing him to handle the matter (both by her diligent care, and good aduifement) ſo cunningly, as it ſhould goe hard, but that (before fewe dayes were gone and paſt) ſhee would vnderſtand and know all.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſhee did indeed, ſpeaking (then more truer then ſhee was aware of. For after ſhee had vſed to come and viſite him (now and than) he began to recouer preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie well: inſomuch as one day, the gentlewoman finding him alone, intteated him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kindely to walke with her into the garden hard by, ſomewhat to recreate himſelfe, (and to reuiue him in that feeble and weake eſtate) telling him, it would not be amiſſe for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15406:119"/>him (now and than) to take the open aire: which words, ſhe deliuered with ſo ſweet a grace, and ſo lonely a ſmile, as (now) he was ten times deeper in loue with her, than he had bene before. O how fooliſh are Louers, who becauſe they themſelues are ſenſeleſſe, therefore they thinke that euery one elſe is ſo likewiſe; and that, becauſe they loue, therefore, none ſhould be exempted from louing: eſpecially this is one of their conceits, as concerning ſuch women as they affect, that becauſe they are men worthie to be liked, therefore (forfooth) theſe women muſt loue them, if they but giue them neuer ſo little entertainment.</p>
               <p>And ſo this vaine <hi>Antonio</hi> perſwaded himſelfe verily, that his friends wife, affected him, becauſe ſhe vouchſafed (in priuate) to walke abroad with him. He that hath bene long ſicke, is ſo deſirous of his health, that the leaſt eaſe or amendment that he findeth, maketh him beleeue he is well recouered and whole. And ſo fareth it with theſe Louers, who if they receiue the leaſt fauour that may be, at their Ladies hands, they (ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies) thinke, they are their owne.</p>
               <p>Now was <hi>Antomo</hi> where he would be, for he might (at leiſure) behold the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eies, the louely face, and the faire breaſts of his ſweet Miſtris, but the more the fond man gazed vpon them, the more he was burnt with a ſecret inward fire, theſe rare beauties of hers, drawing him into the bottom leſſe gulfe of his vtter ouerthrow; as the whirle Pooles in the Seas, by many windings and turnings, ſtill by little and little the ſhips within their circled armes, and ſo deuour and ſwallow them vp: meane ſpace, wretched <hi>Antonio,</hi> one while, by his lookes, another while by his ſighes, one while chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging countenance, and another while, looking red as fire, diſcouered vnto his Miſtris (ſo liuely) the ſecret griefe that tormented him within his ſoule, as ſhe needed to haue knowne no more, had ſhe bene trained vp ſo well as hee, in the ſchoole of Loue.</p>
               <p>But, as the right, true, and honourable Captaine, ſuſpecteth not any treaſon, becauſe he knoweth not what it meaneth, and for that he neuer did couet to learne the ſame, ſo this rare Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewoman, hauing neuer learnd, how to entertaine or like any one, except her husband, could not conceiue the amorous faſhions of <hi>Antonio,</hi> nor what he meant, making loue vnto her, which was the reaſon, his ſorrowes ſlaked not, but rather encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more and more. His fearefull glaunces which he ſtole vpon her, and his ſcalding ſighes (faithfull meſſengers of his minde) forget not to ſet out the ſorrow that he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. One while he looked pale for feare, another while he bluſhed red for ſhame, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, beginning to ſpeake, and ſo made an end before he had begun. His heart is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that his tongue ſhould diſcouer his ſicknes vnto his Phyſition, but his tongue (who doubteth he ſhall make the matter worſe by ſpeaking) hath not the courage to ſpeake one word. His head is intoxicated, and troubled, whilſt thouſands of imaginations run in his braine.</p>
               <p>Now he is reſolute to bewray his griefe vnto her, and now againe he is of a quite contrarie opinion, not to doe it, whilſt he both hopeth and feareth, and all at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. But, ô wretched carkaſſe the while, to entertaine ſo many, and ſo diuers enemies, within it. Feare oppoſeth himſelfe againſt Loue, who faine would ſpeake, and yet reſpect doth ſtop and hinder his deſire. Faine would he haue ſome ſtranger to deliuer his minde vnto his Ladie in his behalfe, by which meanes (ſhould he haue the deniall which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie apprehended in his thought) yet being deliuered vnto him, at a ſecond hand, he thought it would not be altogether ſo terrible vnto him.</p>
               <p>But he too well knoweth that there is not any that can doe it, or that knoweth his ſecret meaning but himſelfe, and therefore as the ſaying is, he muſt make a Page of his owne age, or elſe he muſt continue as he did, without bewraying his minde at all. One while he held downe his face for ſhame, fixing his eies vpon the ground, and an other while Loue lifted them vp againe, forcing him to ſtare, and gaze vpon the faire counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Miſtris, he had all the geſtures and ſignes of a moſt miſerable Louer attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Loue, ſpeech onely accepted, and he that is a firme and zealous Louer indeed, neuer walketh without reſpect and fear.</p>
               <p>The Centlewoman perceiueth ſuch alteration in his face, and that he often began to ſpeake, was very importunate with him to know what he ment, and what he ailed. But
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15406:120"/>euery word ſhe ſpake, was as a ſtabbe of a Poinard, giuen him at the hart. He feareth to ſpeake, what might make his wound worſe, and doubteth as much, leaſt he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Ladie, who (as he thought) might (perhaps) enquire the cauſe thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would heale it.</p>
               <p>The fit opportunitie he had, made him to think, that it were beſt for him, (now) to lay open his minde or elſe neuer, thinking, that when he would, he ſhould not finde ſo apt a time againe; and now againe a new toy taketh him in the head, perſwading him to remit and referre this buſines vntill another day, but then, by and by, he condemneth himſelfe as vnwiſe, that hauing ſpent ſo much time, to finde this commoditie, and now (at the laſt) hauing gotten it, he goeth about to leaue it. In the end, being vrged (ſtill) by the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to reſolue her of her doubt, and ſeeing that he could not well be rid of her, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he did ſatisfie her, in what ſhe demaunded, he determined whatſoeuer ſhould come of it, to breake this Ice, and to bewray his Loue vnto her, whereupon with a ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and often faultring in his voice, he thus began.</p>
               <p>(Faire Miſtris) I was in good hope, that my often ſighing, with my heauie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed countenance, had bene ſufficient to haue bewrayed the ſorrow that galleth my heart, without of hauing had any neede to pleade for pittie vnto you, with my mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tongue.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing it pleaſeth you, that my ſpeech ſhall deliuer what my heart gaue my troubled countenance in charge, I thinke it but reaſon ſo to doe, it being the command of her, who is the cauſe of this my wofull martyrdome, I know I doe but ſow my ſeede vpon the ſalt ſea ſhore, and that I lay my nets (although in vaine) to catch the windes, and yet had I rather to depriue my ſelfe of all comfort and ioy, then diſpleaſe you, and ſend you away iuſtly incenſed againſt me. He that hath deuoted himſelfe vnto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of any woman, &amp; will ſhew all dutifull reſpect that may be vnto her, will haue great regard that he offend her not, &amp; will rather endure any puniſhment in his owne perſon, than moue her whom he vowed to adore with all reuerence.</p>
               <p>Seeing then you haue ſo earneſtly commaunded me to open vnto you the very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of my ſoule, and the firſt cauſes and originall of all my trouble, I will condeſcend vnto you, and moſt faithfully deliuer the ſame, without keeping backe any thing from you at all.</p>
               <p>Knowe then (ſweet Ladie) that your diamond eies, haue bene the torches that hath firſt lightned this fire, your beauties haue bene the Fewell, and your courtly behauiour the bellowes to kindle the ſame. You onely haue made the wound, and if you liſt may heale it, and from no other but from your ſelfe, am I to ſeeke comfort, for the wounds of Loue are healed by the ſelfeſame dart that made them, as the Scorpion doth, who is of power to helpe ſuch, whom he before hath ſtung. Iudge then (I beſeech you) in what a pittifull plight I am, and what great cauſe I haue to curſe and bewaile my hard diſaſter. For what hope to recouer my ſelfe of this daungerous diſeaſe haue I? and how is it poſſible for me, to obtaine that, for which (ſo much) I wiſh?</p>
               <p>Alas, I know not I, and yet <hi>Mirrha,</hi> ioyned her deſire (although it were inceſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) with her owne Father. And <hi>Paſſiphae,</hi> Queene of <hi>Candio,</hi> had her pleaſure of a Bull, quenching by that meanes, her vnhoneſt heate. But I (poore wretched Caitiffe) how may I purchaſe that which (ſo faine) I would, except your fauourable grace, take compaſſion vpon me, in vouchſafing vnto my deadly ſore, that comfortable remedie lying in your hands, which (onely) is offorce to make me well.</p>
               <p>Then, what ſhould I vſe ſo many words, or trouble you with ſo tedious a diſcourſe? Onely this I will ſay, that I hate mine owne ſelfe, becauſe I would loue you, aſſuring your ſelfe, that my life ſhall as ſoone be conuerted into aſhes, as my ſoule is likely to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the fire of Loue, vnleſſe you caſt this neceſſarie water vpon it, to quench the heate thereof, putting my dying heart in ſecuritie of ſome good hope to come. I am bold (deare Miſtris) to be thus plaine with you, becauſe I am reſolute, and haue ſet vp my reſt, to chuſe one of theſe two waies, either that of death, as ſoone as you ſhall pronounce the ſentence of deniall vnto me, or that of life, if I ſhall finde you readie and milde, to eaſe me of my paine.</p>
               <p>Thinke then as you pleaſe of this my ſpeech, and cenſure of me as you ſhall beſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15406:120"/>like: here I ſtand, before the barre of your beautie, expecting either life, or death, the one being as agreeable vnto me, as the other: and although I muſt needs tell you that it ſhall be farre greater glorie for you to ſaue me, than to cut me off before my time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonio,</hi> hauing deliuered his minde in this deſperate kinde of manner, made the Gentlewoman ſo amazed to heare ſuch an occaſion vnexpected from him, as ſhe ſcarce knew where ſhe was.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Her ſpeech was gone, pale, earthly, was her ſight,</l>
                  <l>A ſtone (not liuing creature) ſeemd ſhe right.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But being come vnto her ſelfe againe, ſhe began to curſe within her ſelfe, her foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ouer hardines, in that ſhe was ſo earneſt and inquiſitiue to know of him the reaſon of his diſcontentments, when it concerned her nothing at all, doubting leaſt if any diſgrace ſhould happen about the ſame, all the blame ſhould be laide vpon her. How to replie (vpon the ſudden) ſhe knew not, and whilſt ſhe was muſing what ſhe might doe, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hate him deadly, wiſhing vengeance to light vpon him, for preſuming to court her with ſuch ſhameleſſe impudencie. Now whilſt ſhe ſtood thus bethinking her ſelfe of the matter, <hi>Antonio</hi> ſtraitway, imagined it was for his good, that ſhe delaied ſo long to aunſwere him; but he found the contrarie too ſoone, for (in the meane time) ſhe remembred her owne honour and chaſtitie, and the great friendſhip her husband had ſhewed (though vndeſeruedly) vnto this traiterous friend of his, which ſo incenſt her with iuſt rage and choller, as ſhe began to take vp my Gentleman in this ſort. How now ſir, what is this you ſay, dreame you, or are you well in your right wits? What ſigne or likeliſhood of vice or diſhoneſtie haue you ſeene in me, that you ſhould thus proudly ſollicite and importune me, to diſhonour my ſelfé and my kinde husband, who loueth you farre dearer then his owne ſelfe? was there euer any ſo bold to attempt an enterpriſe ſo difficult and hard as this is, which thou goeſt about, without he had bene aſſured before by ſome geſſe or other that he might bring the ſame to paſſe? I thinke none but thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But tell me I pray you <hi>(Antonio)</hi> what notice or teſtimonie of lightnes haue I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the world (at any time) that you ſhould dare thus immodeſtly to accoſt me? Goe to your Minions and Curtizans abroad, and court them and not me, there make a ſpoke vnto ſuch like huſwiues, who haue no reſpect either of good name or fame. You are no Chapman for my Marchandiſe, no gold can buy mine honour, I hold it at ſo high a rate, neither can any loue or affection purchaſe the faith which I haue paund and promiſde vnto my husband. I am no <hi>Laies,</hi> nor any <hi>Thais,</hi> that thou ſhouldſt ſeeke to vrge me thus; thy perſwaſions being ſo perillous vnto me. Beſides, I am leaſt bound vnto thee, than vnto any other (in that) thou, as my mortall enemie lieſt in waite to ſpoyle and ruinate that which is ten thouſand times more pretious vnto me than mine owne life.</p>
               <p>Thinke, that neuer the Romane <hi>Lucrece</hi> redeemed more couragiouſly the loſſe of credit, with the price of her blood, then I deſire after the ſame rate to preſerue mine, and that I had alwaies chuſe rather to die, a chaſte and faithfull wife, then liue like a moſt diſhoneſt and diſloyall harlot. I rather couet the troubles and croſſes of <hi>Penelope,</hi> with her ſlainleſſe vertue, then the merrie life of <hi>Clitemnestra,</hi> with all her foule and beaſtly pleaſures. And the death of a ſober <hi>Polixena,</hi> ſhall be ſtill more agreeable vnto me, than the voluptuous liuing of a wanton <hi>Semiramis,</hi> being glutted with all ſorts of vaine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and dainties whatſoeuer. Talke no more (then) vnto me of this matter, for thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt but looſe thy labour: for ſooner ſhall the heauens become Sea, and faire grow to be Ice, before I will yeeld vnto the leaſt of thy requeſts. And were it not but that I am in hope that there are ſome ſparkes of grace in thee, and that thou wilt become a new man, I would take ſuch order to make thee giue ouer, and to bridle this thy raſh attempt, as thou ſhouldeſt (neuer) ſpeake more vnto me thereof, by laying open and diſplaying thy ſhameleſſe practiſe vnto him, who may with good reaſon and Iuſtice, be reuenged of thee for a buſing him (ſo much) as thou haſt done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cynthia,</hi> (for ſo was the Gentlewomans name) hauing cooled <hi>Antonios</hi> heate with this ſharpe iniectiue, moued with iuſt chollor, left him, and returned into her houſe, he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15406:121"/>being as much amazed and confounded therewith, as thoſe were, who went about the building of the Tower of <hi>Babell,</hi> ſeeing themſelues ſo ſodenly to haue ſo many langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amongſt them, and ſo different in their proceedings one againſt another. As that Murtherer is mightily aſtoniſht, and in a moſt bad taking, vpon whom the Iudge at vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares commeth, as he is wiping of his bloodie ſword, and ſtandeth by the carkaſſe of him that he hath ſlaughtered, becauſe he ſeeth there is no way (but one) with him, which is the loſſe of his life: Euen ſo was <hi>Antonio</hi> in ſuch a plight; long time did he ſtand as ſtill as a ſtone, and no ſooner was he able to ſpeake, but that he began to lament and crie out afreſh. No heart (were it neuer ſo obdurate and hard) had bene able to haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo heauie a burthen of torments as he did.</p>
               <p>And now he beginneth to hate Loue, the motiue of his miſeries: he accuſeth his Miſtris, the Author of his diſpaire: deteſteth his fortune, that his ſucceſſe was no better in his ſute: and curſeth his tongue, which for being ouer ſawſie and preſumptuous, had vtterly ouerthrowne him for euer.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>All ioy he bids adue, all hope farewell,</l>
                  <l>No longer now in ſorrow, he will dwell.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He is fullie bent to die, deuiſing with himſelfe, what kinde of death he were beſt to chuſe, to the end he might be rid, both of the world, and of his wretched eſtate, all at one time, he will (now) neither ſigh nor weepe more for the matter, determining to change his teares into blood, and his ſighes into wofull death: onely his deſire is, to be fitted of a conuenient place to put in practiſe the ſame, for he durſt not lay violent hands vpon himſelfe in the Caſtle of <hi>Leander,</hi> leaſt (perhaps) it ſhould come to light why he made himſelfe ſo away: whereupon he priuily conueieth himſelfe away from thence, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him into a thicke and darke wood, not farre from thenee, where he reſolueth to end his life, and make that place his graue. It was aunſwerable vnto his minde, it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, obſcure, &amp; vnfrequented of all. This was the cauſe he began afreſh (being all alone) to ſigh and ſob, and to ban and curſe his ill fortune againe, which being done, he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſword, he feeleth the edge of it, to ſee if it be keene and ſharpe enough, and that done, prepareth himſelfe vnto death, thinking it to be much better to die by his owne proper hands, as another braue and high minded <hi>Aiax,</hi> than to liue in continuall vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miſerie, as a baſe and degenerate <hi>Theſites.</hi> And now he ſetteth the pommell of his blade vpon the ground, the poynt whereof was placed iuſt againſt his heart, when (as he was minded to thruſt himſelfe quite through) behold, death (as he thought) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto him, with ſo horrible and gaſtly a viſage, as he gaue ouer his enterpriſe: long was he not in this muſe, but that he drew his Raiper againe, condemning much his firſt feare, when (vpon the ſodaine) an other humor (more diuiliſh than the reſt) tooke him, which was not to die, vntill he had obtained what he ſo much coueted, vowing within his ſoule, that he would haue his will of the faire <hi>Cynthia,</hi> at what high price ſoeuer he bought it.</p>
               <p>His Loue (now) was turned into hate, and his reſpectfull duetie, into ſenſuall luſt. He thinketh not of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger he is like to incurre, by entring into ſo infamous an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All former friendſhip and kinde Hoſpitalitie is forgotten, ſo he may haue his wiſh, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by violence, or what way elſe, he cares not, although (afterward) he die for the ſame: for (ſo to die, he imagineth) he ſhall be moſt happie: and this is his moſt certaine and conſtant reſolution.</p>
               <p>O franticke rage, O curſed madnes, and O cruell furiouſnes of Loue! This made <hi>Medea</hi> worſe than a Bedlem, to maſſacre her owne children: and this brought the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> to loſe both his honour and his life. Now <hi>Antonio</hi> hammering in his head this wicked practiſe, began to ſet a good vpon the matter, as if all had bene well, beginning to looke cheerfully, and making the world beleeue he had quite forgotten all former ſorrowes, as if he would haue bene merrie euer after, which recouerie from his ſicknes, made euery one glad, eſpecially his true friend <hi>Leander,</hi> and the Ladie his wife, who (verily) thought, that <hi>Antonio</hi> had forgotten all his old loue to wards her, and that her ſchooling of him, in that ſhroad manner as ſhe did, had made him to be come a new man.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:15406:121"/>
               <p>But alas (poore ſoule) how much was ſhe deceiued, for all this while, <hi>Antonio</hi> was working of treaſon againſt her, and her husband, which wrought their vtter ouerthrew. As a fire that long time lie hid in a hollow hole, when it burſteth forth, becommeth more violent, more outragious, and more hurtfull, than when it beginneth firſt to burn; Euen ſo the villainie of <hi>Antonio,</hi> was farre more terrible (making no ſhew of any ſuch thing) then if he had put it in practiſe (before) when he was in his ſicknes, languiſhing through paine: for he hauing bethought himſelfe what he would haue them to doe, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a companie of notable Raſcalls (ſecretly) together, certifying them what he would haue them to doe for him, euery one of them being as readie to condeſcend vnto him, in hope of baſe gaine, as he to commaund them: and the rather, when they knew it was to put in practiſe ſo damned a deed, ſuch curſed murtherers as thoſe being (alwaies) more prone to euill, than vnto good.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing ſet euery thing in order; he moſt ſolemnely inuiteth <hi>Leander</hi> and his louing wife, to feaſt with him, vpon a certaine day appointed for the purpoſe, who ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting no treacherie, very kindly accepted of the ſame, promiſing for himſelfe, and for his wife, not to faile but to be there. O how worthie is a falſe and trecherous friend of the greateſt puniſhment that may be, who plaieth the falſe counterfeit, and of a deare friend, becommeth a deadly foe? and how farre more hurtfull is he, than an open and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemie, for of the one a man can hardly take heed, becauſe he carrieth the vaile of friendſhip to nide his treacherie, but the other we may eaſily auoide, by reaſon we know, he ſeeketh to doe vs any iniurie that lieth in his power.</p>
               <p>Poore <hi>Leander</hi> found this to be true vnto his coſt. For comming vnto <hi>Antonio</hi> his houſe, with his wife, at the firſt meeting, he made a ſhew vnto them, of a moſt ſolemne and hartie welcome, but no ſooner were they ſet at the table, thinking to be merrie, and that they were there as ſafe, as if their had bene in their owne Caſtle, but behold the ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly Murtherers being diſguiſed, brake in (vpon the ſodaine) amongſt them, with their naked ſwords in their hands, running vpon <hi>Leander,</hi> and giuing him many wounds, and that done, they laid violent hands vpon his wofull wife, carrying her away (perforce) and leauing him there for dead, wallowing in his luke-warme blood.</p>
               <p>It is an old ſaying, that gold is a bad ſeruant, being the occaſion many times that his owne maiſters throate is cut, and that rich men liue the wretchedſt liues of all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue great care, and much adoe to keepe their goods, and are in as great a feare (continually) leaſt they ſhould loſe them: yet I am of this conceit, that a faire wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is (farre more) hurtfull vnto her husband, ſhe being as much laide for, or rather more than his gold is, for gold (except it be taken away by force) neuer offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto a ſtraunger, nor betrayeth his Lord: whereas, a beautifull wife (oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting her ſelfe) her honour, and her faith, ſuffereth her ſelfe to be carried away by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo betraieth her husband, who (afterward) either dieth for griefe, or (elſe) hath his throate cut by his wiues Champion and friend.</p>
               <p>So was <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſlaine by his wife: ſo died <hi>Achilles</hi> for <hi>Polixenas</hi> ſake: and ſo were the <hi>Sabin</hi> women, the cauſe of the warres betweene their owne countrimen and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. But (now) who could in liuely colours ſet forth the vnſpeakable griefe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Cynthia,</hi> the eſpouſe of <hi>Leander,</hi> ſhe thinking he was dead, and her ſelfe being in the hands of her moſt deadly enemies? What penne were able to write all her pittifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? what paper were ſufficient to containe her laments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and what report, her more then dolefull ſpeeches?</p>
               <p>Vngratious <hi>Antonio,</hi> the Author of all theſe euils, hauing now the prey he ſo long time deſired, leaueth his houſe (preſently) carrying her away (in poſt) with him, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to goe (ſo farre off) as he ſhould neuer be heard of afterward, not caring for any thing elſe, but for her perſon; and the rather, becauſe he had gotten in his purſe great ſtore of gold and Iewels to defray his charges in his iourney.</p>
               <p>But leauing him galloping away with her, we will come (againe) vnto <hi>Leander,</hi> who being found to haue (as yet) ſome life in him, was carried home vnto his Caſtle, where his wounds being ſearched by a reuerend Hermit (dwelling not far from him) and one that was very skilfull in Chyrurgerie, and ſoueraine medicines applied vnto the ſame, he recouered, and was cured before he was aware. But though he was well in bodie, yet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15406:122"/>was he not ſo in minde, for the vnfortunate knight had many fearefull conceits, that troubled him in his head; one while the diſſoya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ltie of his friend gaulled him, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, the departure of his wife grieued him, but that which moſt vexed his ſoule, was, that he had a vehement ſuſpirion, ſhe ſhould be priuie vnto this conſpiracie, and ſo (by conſequence) partaker of this murther, as willing, he ſhould be made away.</p>
               <p>Neuer were the ſhips of <hi>Aeneas</hi> or <hi>T'liſſes,</hi> toſt ſo furiouſly and with contrarie windes, vpon the ſwelling waues of the ſoming Seas, as his minde was canuaſed and carried too and fro, with diuers opinions and thoughts, as concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>When a man hapneth to haue any ſtrange miſchance, he (ſtill) doth conſture eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in the worſe part; becauſe, he thinketh euery body ſhould be againſt him, by reaſon ill fortunes is ſo common and ordinarie vnto him, and therefore he laieth the cauſe of his Diſaſter, vpon euery one, and this was it that made the diſtemperato <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to ſuppoſe, that his modeſt wife, had bene conſenting vnto his plot laid for him, and that he had made her <hi>Pailiard,</hi> to put the ſame in practiſe, becauſe he had ſuch a firme confidence in his friendſhip, as he could (hardly) be induced to thinke, that he would (euer) haue perpetrated ſuch an hainous act, vnleſſe his wife had very earneſtly prouoked and vrged him to baue done it.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, how the Pilgrim (oftentimes) in the night, taketh the wrong way fot the right, and how ſome take blacke for white, and yellow for red, in colours. Yet muſt I needes ſay, that ſuch are to be pardoned in ſome ſort (although they cenſure ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſhly and haſtily) who comming from hauing a ſhrewd turne done vnto them, know not, but as they blindly geſſe, whom they ſhould iuſtly blame, for true griefe deſerueth pardon, and looſers haue alwaies leaue to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>But the righteous God aboue, who knoweth the truth of all things, did diſcouer this, at the fitteſt time for diſtreſſed <hi>Cynthia,</hi> to cleare her, as ſometimes he did <hi>Suſanua,</hi> of this villainie, falſely imputed vnto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leander,</hi> waxing ſtrong in bodie (although troubled ſore in minde) determined, either to die, or elſe to find out the traitor, that had offered him this monſtrous outrage, vowing to be reuenged on him; as alſo, to ſeeke his wife, whom likewiſe he ment to puniſh, if he ſhould find her acceſſarie, in any point of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, he armeth himſelfe, getteth vpon his horſe backe, and accompanied by three or foure Gentlemen (his friends) he ſearcheth all the countrie thereabouts, to ſee, if he could heare any tidings, either of that treacherous villaine, or of his wife. In the end, he lighteth vpon a great thicke &amp; gloomie Forreſt, through which, as he rode, he found a dead carkaſſe of a man, and a woman lying by him, being in little better caſe then he was.</p>
               <p>But leauing <hi>Leander</hi> and his companions ſeeking their aduenture, we will come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wofull <hi>Cynthia</hi> his wife, and (when fit time ſhall ſerue) we will diſcouer who was that creature dead, and who that woman, being almoſt in as bad a taking as he, vpon whom <hi>Loander</hi> (ſo ſtrongly) hapned. <hi>Cynthia</hi> being carried away from her husband, ſo ſoden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by ſuch barbarous treacherie, was (for a great while) as one in a traunce, hardly comming vnto her ſelfe againe.</p>
               <p>And certainlie (I thinke) that if women were ſubiect by nature to die for ſorrow, then (no doubt) but ſhe had died, for neuer was there woman in this world, more ſad or heauie than ſhe was, no not <hi>Niobe, Hecuba, Oenone, Porcia, Cornelia,</hi> nor any other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, were ſhe neuer ſo ouerwhelmed with miſeries. But this kinde of death ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is incident vnto the Female kinde, as that of ſodaine ioy is.</p>
               <p>Long lay ſhe in this Extaſie or ſound, and (long) was ſhe before ſhe recouered her right ſences againe, and (ſo much) was ſhe aſtoniſht in her minde with the ſame, as the paſſage of her ſpeech was kept cloſe, and ſhut from her, yet (at the laſt) her vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits recouered force within her, and her tongue had libertie to ſpeake.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hellena</hi> was rauiſhed, (but) with her owne conſent. Neither did her rauiſhment bereaue her husbands life, as hers did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Penelope</hi> was dailie and hourely ſollicited and importuned, by a number of tedious and impudent ſuters, but yet ſhe was ſuffered to liue chaſtly, and to attend the returne of her <hi>Vliſſes.</hi>

                  <hi>Hecuba</hi> (after ſhee had ſeene her husband murthered, and all her ſonnes ſlaine) was led away as a captiue or ſlaue into <hi>Greece:</hi> and (yet) had ſhee more reaſon to haue borne with patience theſe her misfortunes, (though in a higher degree of miſerie) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Cynthia</hi> in hers.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Hecubas</hi> miſchaunces proceeded from her enemies, to whom the law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons giueth leaue to doe what miſchiefe they can: whereas hapleſſe <hi>Cymhias</hi> vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, came from him, whome ſhe eſteemed as the deareſt and moſt faithfull friend her Husband had.</p>

                  <hi>Lucrctia,</hi> for loſſe of chaſtitie ſlewe her owne ſelfe, but her death was the death of her aduerſarie, and the life and libertie of all her <hi>Romane</hi> Citizens.

               <p>Infinit were the occaſions that ſhe had to complaine, and the reaſons without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that compelled her to exclaime againſt the moſt partiall Deſtinies. For what could ſhe looſe more pretious and deare, then her ſweet Spouſe, whom ſhe eſteemed more then her honor, and her owne life?</p>
               <p>Needs therefore, muſt her complaints be greeuous, and her lamentings heauie and bitter, as one that diſpaired of all comfort to come.</p>
               <p>Ah (woe is me, cried ſhee out) why was I borne, and why did my mother bring me into this world? ſince there is no perſon liuing (ſo vnfortunate) as I am? for I doe not count thoſe miſerable, who haue liberty to ſhorten their owne dayes by death, but onely ſuch as faine would die, and yet cannot. Is it poſſible, that one ſhould be borne vnder ſo hard a Planet, as not to be able to die, when moſt faineſt he would?</p>
               <p>O how great is that euill, when it forceth vs to require ayde of the Fatall ſiſters, to ridde vs of the ſame, whom men deteſt and loath, as their mortall enemies? And (yet) can none but they, relieue and eaſe ſuch wretched creatures.</p>
               <p>The healthie man, (whilſt he is well) loatheth and abhorreth, to take, or taſte anie potion or medicine, but when he is ſicke, he is glad and faine to ſwallowe it downe, be it neuer ſo bitter and ſower. So we, whilſt we liue merilie, and at harts eaſe, we contemne death, but when our griefes are ſo great as wee are not able to endure them, then we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our ſelues, as happie to haue him.</p>
               <p>O God, is it poſſible for me to be able in words to deliuer my loſſes, for my ſighes to deplore them? for mine eyes to bewaile them? or for my heart to be of force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them? If the loſſe of paltrie goods maketh men outragious in their paſſions, and if the death of our kinsfolks or friends, be ſufficient to engender afflictions in vs, how much more then, haue I cauſe of inſupportable ſorrowes?</p>
               <p>Alas, I haue loſt my kinde husband, but am I able to ſay ſo, and not my ſoule to flie forth of this miſerable bodie? or is my condition ſo miſerable, that I may ſay, I haue loſt him indeed? No, no, I will neuer belieue it, rather will I die, then perſwade my ſelfe, of any ſuch vnwelcome matter vnto me.</p>
               <p>But ſay I die, yet haue I loſt him, yea I haue loſt him, and onely through mine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

No more then the Drunkard (being ouercome with too much liquor) can iudge of good wine, whilſt wee being rocked a ſleepe in the cradle of ſenſualitie, deſpiſe his mercies, as Porklings and hogges doe Malt and Acorns, when their bellies is full of them, but being once pinched with hunger, runne vp and downe for them, as they were madde.</p>
               <p>So wee, whilſt we liue in pleaſure, cannot rightly know how ſweete the fauours and kindneſſe of God is, becauſe we are glutted with worldly delights. But when wee are (once afflicted with miſerie, wee (then) finde the comfortableneſſe of the ſame, and can quickly iudge, how neceſſarie it is vnto vs, for our good and welfare.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Cynthia</hi> found, although after a ſtraunge faſhion. For thoſe vngodlie Theeues, which wicked <hi>Antonio</hi> had hired, to be his bloodie executioners in this his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Teagedie, (not daring, for feare of being tortured with plagues) to ſtay in the Countrey, after they had committed this deteſtable outrage, followed him as faſt as they could; Amongſt which, there was one, more bolde then the reſt, who marking the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and comelineſſe of <hi>Cynthia,</hi> (although as then ſhe looked pale and leane, for verie anguiſh and griefe) grewe to be amorous of her, determining with himſelfe, to haue his pleaſure of her, although he paide neuer ſo dearely for it.</p>
               <p>Thus was the poore Gentlewoman, come out of Gods bleſſing into a warme Sunne, and fallen from a plaine Ague, into a hote burning Feuer, and yet this misfortune, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the end, vnto her good.</p>

               <p>So wee ſee the rauenous Wolues to howle, and to bicker one with another: the greedineſſe in feeding, hindering them to knowe themſelues, although they be all of one companie: and ſo the ſent and ſweetneſſe of the prey, maketh Theeues to forget their former kindneſſe (amongſt themſelues) egging them forward, to cut one anothers throate, to haue the more gaine.</p>

               <p>It is a very difficult and hard matter to giue ouer any kinde of vice, eſpecially, if a man take an habit in the ſame: for then, the more hee marcheth forward to exerciſe it, the more he is plunged ouer head and eares in it. Not vnlike vnto the horned Stagge, who the more he ſeeketh to get out of the Toyle, (which as a ſnare, was left to intrappe him) the more he intangleth and windeth himſelfe therein.</p>

               <p>Thus was the chaſte <hi>Iphiginea</hi> ſacrificed: ſo was the baſhfull <hi>Polixena,</hi> put to death: and ſo dyed the vertuous daughter of <hi>Iepha,</hi> with diuers other Virgins, who to conſerue their Chaſtitie, left both their liues and ſoules together.</p>
               <p>This murther done, there followed another, for theſe Rakehells, fearing to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for doing the deed, and willing to be gone, vrged their fellow Theefe to make haſte away, with them, but he was ſo farre in loue with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> (who lay at the point of death) as by no meanes he would leaue her: which they perceiuing, and doubting leaſt (if hee ſhould be found there) he would bewray, and appeach them all, thought to make ſure worke, as nigh as they could, and ſo thruſting him through, they truſſed vp their bagge and baggage, carrying away <hi>Antonio</hi> his Treaſure with them, leauing <hi>Cynthia</hi> readie to giue vp the ghoſt, who though ſhee were ſo nigh her ende, yet could ſhe ſpeake a little.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were theſe Hell-hounds gone from her, but ſhee beganne to take ſome ſmall comfort in her minde, counting her ſelfe as bleſſed, to die in this manner, hauing a ſure confidence, that ſhe ſhould ſee her husband in Heauen: the glorie whereof, ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to enioy, becauſe ſhe had ſo luckily preſerued her honour.</p>
               <p>O how ſweete a thing is death vnto them, who are deſirous to die, when they ſee themſelues disfranchiſed, and freed from all misfortunes, and when they find their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, with the vpſhot of their liues.</p>
               <p>Such was the death of the modeſt and pudike <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and with ſuch ioy did <hi>Thiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> leaue the world, to follow her beloued <hi>Piramus:</hi> for death is not of power to vnbinde the hearts of true Louers. No, no: they muſt follow one another, euen into the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian</hi> fieldes, and there, tye (againe) thoſe chaines, which death before had broken in ſunder.</p>
               <p>And now ſweet <hi>Cynthia</hi> perceiuing her ſelfe to be alone, and readie to render vp her Soule vnto her firſt Redeemer, lifting vp her eyes to heauen, began to make this prayer.</p>
               <p>I knowe and acknowledge, I confeſſe, and proclaime all abroad, that thy ſpeech (ô moſt gratious <hi>GOD</hi>) is both Sacred, true, and veritable: which is that thou aſſureſt ſuccour and aide, vnto ſuch of thy diſtreſſed ſeruants, as be readie to diſpaire, for want of helpe.</p>
               <p>So diddeſt thou relieue that Countrey of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> which was wel-nigh ſtarued with famine, through the wiſedome of chaſte <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Thou diddeſt aſſiſt the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their great extreamie: when the red Sea gaue backe, to make them paſſage, drowning their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which went about to purſue and follow after them. Thou diddeſt ſend the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid people moſt miraculouſly <hi>Manna</hi> from heauen, when they were (almoſt) dead for very hunger. Thou diddeſt make cleare water to flowe from the hard and frozen Rocke, to ſtaunch their drineſſe: and thou (Lord) didſt free them from the power of <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi> by thy holie Angell.

               <p>Thrice happie I, that through thy ſacred guiding of me, haue eſcaped this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but far more bleſſed, in that I ſhall leaue this world, in this bad and wretched time, where nothing doth raigne and dominiere, but vice, Treaſon, and violence.</p>
               <p>I moſt humblie thanke thee, moſt mercifull Father, for ſo great a benefite beſtowed vpon me: For what could happen more acceptable vnto me, then to follow my deare Husband into heauen, thereto continue with him, and to enioy euerlaſting glorie with thy Saintes? Let vs die willingly, then <hi>(Cynthia)</hi> with a braue minde and conſtant reſolution, leauing a rich teſtimony of our loyall loue and affection, vnto the poſteritie that ſhall come hereafter.</p>
               <p>And although a faithfull Chriſtian ought not, (as hee is dying) either to deſire, or to wiſh anie vengeance for to light vpon his aduerſaries and enemies: yet muſt I needs confeſſe, that it is a great ſolace and contentment vnto mee, to die in the middeſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15406:125"/>of ſuch as were foes vnto my <hi>Leander,</hi> land mine honour, and the rather, becauſe they are dead as well as I, to make ſatisfaction for their faults.</p>
               <p>O <hi>GOD,</hi> how ſacred are thy decrees, how iuſt thy iudgements, and how rightfull thy proceedings? Thou haſt not permitted the murtherers of my Husband to liue long, after they had done ſo horrible a deed, and contrarie to all expectation, thou haſt defended mee from their moſt furious and vnchaſt luſt: and therefore I will take this my croſſe moſt patiently, and will be contented to die, as willinglie, as when I was firſt ioyned by the holie Church, vnto my deare Husband in ſacred marriage bandes, moſt religiouſly.</p>
               <p>And yet (my Soueraigne Sauiour) I greatly feare thy Iuſtice, the number of my faults, weighing farre more heauie then my good deeds, but thou canſt (if thou ſo pleaſe) deface them all.

               <p>O then, let this innocent blood of mine, ſhed by the aduerſaries of thy glorie, be ſufficient to waſh my ſinnes away, through thy grace, and let my modeſt and ſtaineleſſe minde, be as a fire to conſume the number of mine offences.</p>
               <p>O yee mine eyes, the Authors of my diſaſters, cruell and proud eyes, firſt motiues of theſe our common miſeries &amp; calamities: ſoone ſhall you looſe your wanton lights, and ſoone ſhall you be cloſed vp, with an yron ſleepe of death for euer.</p>
               <p>But ô gentle Death, when commeſt thou? come I beſeech thee, come away vnto mee, who art ſo courteous, ſo apte, ſo fit, and ſo profitable for my ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>Often haue I deſired thee, a thouſand times haue I called for thee, and with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of intreaties and prayers, perſwaded thee to come to aſſiſt mee, and (now thou art come) I ſalute thee, and thanke thee, entertaining thee, as one who can ſaue mee from a great loſſe, thou being able to withdraw me from ſhipwracke, and of power ſufficient, to bring me ſafely into the Hauen, where I long ſo much to be.</p>
               <p>O how fooliſh is that Marriner, who being miraculouſlie arriued in the Port, will backe againe into the Sea, whilſt the ſtorme playeth his part, and not ſtay vntill the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be cleare and calme.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, how madde were I, if hauing caſt Anker at the Hauen of my well-fare, I ſhould now begin to wiſh to liue once more, returning backe into this miſerable life, in which we encounter ſo many dangerous Rocks, and perilous ſtumbling blocks, as we can neuer be quiet.</p>

If ſo, why (then) farre more bleſſed are they, who pay their due vnto Nature, vnto whome they are indebted, and who by tendering the ſame vnto her, (which they muſt once doe) are quited and freed from all worldly calamities afterwards to come.</p>
               <p>My onely deſire is to ſee, and ſtand before the preſence of my moſt gracious Lord and <hi>GOD,</hi> and to behold the face of my louing Husband, wayting and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon him.</p>

But God tooke order for that matter. For no ſooner had ſhe made an end of her Praier, but <hi>Leander</hi> (by chaunce) came that way, who perceiuing (farre of) theſe dead bodies, and deſirous to know what they were, ſet ſpurs to his horſe, to ride towards them, and when being come neare them (by little and little) he found, what he ſo much ſought for.</p>
               <p>As the young amorous Bull, ſeeing (a farre of) a young Haifer to brouſe vpon the bankes of a cleare Riuer, approacheth neerer &amp; neerer, to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, if it be his Loue or no, and as he marcheth forward, holdeth vp his head for ioy, becauſe he findeth her by certaine markes to be the ſame. So <hi>Leander,</hi> euery ſtep he goeth, reioyceth greatly in his minde, as aſſuring himſelfe, that he hath (now) found, that which with ſo great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) he had made ſearch for.</p>
               <p>But as that Marchant is not throughly ioyfull, who after he hath made a long, and dangerous voyage, findeth but the halfe part of his Marchandiſe in his ſhip, the gaine of which, drew him to aduenture abroad, and to leaue his countrie and friends.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, <hi>Leander</hi> found himſelfe, but halfe contented and pleaſed, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thoſe to be dead, whom he ſo much coueted (in his minde) to haue encombred them aliue; neuertheleſſe, he drew neerer vnto the place where they lay, marking very wiſtly, both his dead enemies, and his wife.</p>
               <p>As he ſtood (thus) gazing vpon them, diuers conceits ran in his head, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, what to thinke of the matter, one while he thinketh that his wife loued <hi>Antonio</hi> ſo dearely, as ſhe would needes die with him: an other while, he iudgeth rightly of the fact, imagining that ciuill diſcention had cauſed one to kill an other: now, he iudgeth that ſome foe of <hi>Antonios,</hi> had ſtabd him, and then againe, he geſſeth that ſome of his friends had offered him this cruell outrage, for doing ſo great villainie againſt him.</p>
               <p>But Loue croſſed all theſe contrarie conceits, diſpearſing them heere and there, as the cracke of the thunder forceth the cloud to giue way, when it breaketh through the ſame, and falleth vpon the ground below: he thought, he had many iuſt occaſions to hate his wife, meaning (if ſhe had bene aliue) to haue inflicted vpon her, that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he had (alreadie) found her to endure; and yet, when he had a little better conſidered thereof in his minde (ſeeing her to be brought vnto ſo pittifull a ſtraight) he could not chuſe, but muſt (needes) lament and bewaile her hard miſhap. Whileſt ſhe liued, he loathed her, nor will he (by any meanes) be induced, to beleeue that ſhe is culpable of that fault, of which he (before) accuſed her, ſeeing that (now) ſhe is dead.</p>
               <p>A friend is neuer knowne (ſo well) as when he is miſt.

                  <hi>Leander</hi> (lighting of his horſe) kneeleth downe by his wife, weepeth bitterly, and then kiſſeth her, which the poore ſoule perceiuing, maruelling much what this ſhould meane, openeth her dying eies a little, when after ſhe had a good while (wiſtly) looked vpon him, ſhe ſawe and knew him to be liuing, whom ſhe held and accounted to be dead.</p>

               <p>Ah ſay, is it thine owne ſelfe whom I ſee? or is it ſome euill ſpirit that hath taken thy ſhape vpon him, to mocke and delude me? If it be thee, and that thou liueſt (as yet) then thriſe fortunate is <hi>Cynthia</hi> to ſee thee, before ſhe giueth ouer this wretched life. And yet if thou be that <hi>Leander,</hi> who (ſometimes) wert the kind husband of vnhappie <hi>Cynthia,</hi> how (then) canſt thou abide to approach neere vnto her, ſhe hauing bene the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſo many euils lightned vpon thee, thou knowing not whether ſhe be cleare from them or no? But I ſee well, that Loue draweth all ſuch doubts in thee, and will not ſuffer thee, to beleeue any thing that is not good for me.</p>
               <p>And (yet) <hi>Leander,</hi> haſt thou reaſon to conceiue the worſt of me, becauſe I haue bene the occaſion of many troubles, that haue hapned vnto thee; notwithſtanding, I ſweare vnto thee, by that God before whom I hope to be iudged, &amp; who reuengeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry periurie, that I am meerely innocent of what ill ſo euer is done, I hauing not bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, either in bodie or in minde, the Almightie hauing (moſt miraculoſly) preſerued me, from all ſuch harme. Whereupon ſhe began to diſcouer vnto him, all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſince ſhe laſt ſawe him, and withall, how ſhe had not made him acquainted with the affection which <hi>Antonio</hi> bare vnto her (the cauſe of all this miſchiefe) and the reaſon, that it might haue bene preuent, if he had knowne thereof.</p>
               <p>But (ſaid ſhe) I was in good hope he would haue become a new man, being loth to bewray his ſoilie vnto you, becauſe you made ſo great account of him, thinking he would (neuer) haue borre ſo bad a minde towards you. But now I ſee this ſore to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recurable, I know not what to ſay, but onely to craue pardon of you for the ſame, and withall, to take ſome order for my buriall.</p>
               <p>Then (ſweet husband weepe no more) for what reaſon haſt thou to bewaile her death, who hath brought thee ſo many loſſes and vncurable dammages, whileſt ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with thee? rather haue you cauſe to reioyce and be glad to ſee her finall end, and therefore I moſt humbly beſeech you, if you doe loue me indeed (as you ſeeme at this time to make ſome ſhew that you doe) drie vp your teares, ceaſe theſe lamentings, giue ouer this ſighing and ſobbing, and ſuffer me to finiſh this ſmall reſt of my life in ſome pleaſure: for my ſorrow proceedeth not from my death, but for that I ſee thee thus to take on.</p>
               <p>Trouble not then I pray thee, that contentment which I haue to view, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee, before I ſhut vp my dazeling eies, through thy too much lamenting for my death.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt loued me, then call to minde this thy good will towards me, and let the remembrance thereof (now I die) perſwade thee to doe ſo much for me. It is the laſt office of friendſhip, which thou muſt doe for me, for (now) I ſhall trouble thee no more, my glaſſe being runne, and the date of my life (in a manner) quite expired.</p>
               <p>Then graunt me this my requeſt, for my daies, were but daies to ſerue thee, my ſoule, but a ſoule to honour thee, and my heart, but a heart to affect and onely loue thees and I hope, thou haſt found, knowne, and perſwadeſt thy ſelfe, that I ſpeake nothing but truth. Which if thou doeſt, then let me obtaine this laſt Boone of thee, and be not ſo cruell, as to denie me ſo ſmall a matter.</p>
               <p>Grieue then no more (my good <hi>Leander</hi>) for me, which if thou doeſt, I then will cloſe mine eies, and ſhut vp my tongue, becauſe I cannot abide to ſee thee in this heauie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15406:126"/>plight for her, who is vnworthie that thou ſhouldeſt torment thy ſelfe (any way) for her cauſe.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus complained, ſhe held her peace, when her wofull husband (who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this her lamentable diſcourſe, had recouered his ſpeech) began thus to comfort her. Ah my ſweet <hi>Cynthia,</hi> what cauſe of miſlike, haue I euer giuen thee, and when did I vſe thee otherwiſe than became me, that thou ſhouldeſt imagine, I were not able to forbeare thy companie, without great diſcontentment vnto my ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou (then) thinke, that I loue thee not? If ſo thou thinke, (O God) what wrong doeſt thou vnto me? yes <hi>(Cynthia)</hi> yes, I loue thee, yea, and in that ſort, as thou canſt not die without me. Death is not of power ſufficient to extinguiſh my loue, which ſhall liue in deſpite of him, and ſhall ſtill continue with thee, be thou aliue or dead.</p>
               <p>Not ſo ſoone canſt thou command, but I will as willingly condiſcend vnto thee in any thing, and yet thy entreatie cannot hinder me, but that I muſt bewaile thy Diſaſter, and farre more ſhould I take on by oddes, but that my hope is to ſee the (ſhortly) in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. Too zealous and affectionate is my loue towards thee, to ſee thee ſuffer that thou doeſt, and I not to be moued with the ſame.</p>
               <p>O would to God thou wert without hurt or wound, and that I had had that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to haue falne vpon me, which thou now haſt. But ſeeing it cannot be, thou ſhalt not chuſe, but giue me leaue to beare ſome part of thine anguiſh. When we were well, and liued at hearts eaſe, there was not any thing, but what was common betweene vs, all things were alike betweene thee and me, why then ſhouldeſt thou oppoſe thy ſelfe (now) ſo much againſt me, as to denie me, that I ſhould participate of thy troubles with thee?</p>
               <p>No no, I will beare a heauie burthen, in this thy ſorrowfull ſong, and mine eies ſhall ſtreame forth, before I die (as two fountaines of water) all the liquid humour that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth within my reſtleſſe bodie.</p>
               <p>Thou goeſt thy way (my deare <hi>Cynthia</hi>) and leaueſt me here plunged in deepe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, but I will not ſtay long behind, ſoone will I follow after thee, and quickly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible mine eies ſhould giue light vnto my bodie, and want thy ſight? and is it likely I ſhall be able to abſtaine from thy companie for euer, when I cannot endure to forbeare thy preſence one ſhort day?</p>
               <p>O (deare wife) now I coniure thee, by the chaſte pleaſures of our ſacred Hymen, and vnſpotted nuptiall bed, by that Loue of thine and mine (as yet neuer broken) and by thy heart, and mine, which neuer were but one, let me entreate thee, that thou take it not ill, although I die with thee. Great is the authoritie that Loue hath giuen thee ouer me, but yet not ſo great, as it ſhall diſturbe my deſire, or make me follow any other courſe but death.</p>
               <p>Certainely, certainely, I will beare thee companie euen into thy graue. O faire and beautifull eies, mine were you, whileſt you liued, and mine ſhall you be, when you are dead. No man liuing, hath intereſt in you, but my ſelfe, and you, will I as well ſee, being dead, as when you were aliue. O curteous death, if it be poſſible for thee to be entreated by the Praiers, or the cries of mortall wights, or if euer thou haſt done any kindnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then I beſeech thee, let me finde this fauour at thy hands, that I may breath my laſt gaſpe, before my Ladie.</p>
               <p>Doe me this good turne, for all the euill thou haſt done me, and in recompence of ſuch great loſſes, as I am like to ſuſtaine by thee, in ſnatching away from me (moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently) the onely ſupport and Atlaſſe of my life, which if I may not obtaine, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and exclaime againſt thee, making it knowne vnto the whole world, that thou art cruell, and partiall, againſt me onely: for it ſhould much abate and aſſwage my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to goe before her, to the end, I might be exempted from thoſe (more then dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly darts) which will pierce deepely into my ſoule, when I ſhal behold her to be laid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her graue.</p>
               <p>O cruell Tombe, muſt thou be ſo fortunate, as to lodge and entertaine ſo pretious a treaſure, to poſſeſſe ſo rare and louely a beautie, and to encloſe and couer a bodie ſo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15406:127"/>exquiſite and perfect, that ſame, being the chiefe maintainer of my glorie, and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpholder of my life?</p>
               <p>O that ſome gentle power would be ſo kind vnto me, as to transforme me into thy likenes, to the end, I might enioy that benefit, which is permitted to be thine, and of which (whileſt it liued, I was Maiſter and owner.</p>
               <p>And yet thinke not thou ſhalt haue the bodie of my deare wife alone, no no, thou ſhalt haue mine alſo, to beare hers companie, and by that meanes, thou ſhalt receiue two bodies, which (liuing) had but one ſoule betweene them. And now (my ſweet <hi>Cynthia</hi>) let me (once more) take thee by the hand, for a finall farewell, and let me kiſſe thee (once) againe; to the end that my breath may iſſue out of this his earthly mantion, and part hence, at the ſelfe ſame inſtant, that thine paſſeth away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leander</hi> hauing ſo ſaid, and weeping moſt tenderly, taketh the cold carkaſſe of his wife in his armes, often kiſſing, and rekiſſing her colde mouth, he being neuer ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with the delight of that dying, which was wholy at his commaundement whileſt it was liuing. His lips neuer parted from hers, whileſt his eies ſtreamed downe teares, and his heart ſent forth ſcalding ſighes in aboundance.</p>
               <p>O thriſe fortunate ſoules, whom neither death nor ſorrowes could part aſunder, and ô happie couple, who would not haue but one Tombe to encloſe you (both) together. And now <hi>Leander</hi> began to faint as well as his wife, he being ſore wounded with griefe, and Loue, which ſhe perceiuing, forced her ſelfe to vttes theſe fewe words (as well as ſhe could) vnto him. It is enough (ſweet husband) it is enough, you too much trouble your ſicke ſelfe with an vnworthie burthen, for we may count our ſelues bleſſed, in that we haue incountered one with another before we die.</p>
               <p>The end crowneth the workes of man, their glorie lying onely in their deaths; which death ſhall make vs famous for euer, allotting vnto vs the Garland of commendation and praiſe, to continue hereafter.</p>
               <p>For mine owne part, I can no longer liue, and had it not bene for your preſence, I had bene dead long ſince, the ſame hauing bene the occaſion that the thread of my life was drawne forth ſo long as it hath bene; For thee haue I liued, euen vntill this houre, but (alas) what talke I of liuing, when all my ſences faile me, when my voice is going away, and my heart beginneth to be colde within me. What ſhould I ſay more, but that thou liue happily after my deceaſe, baniſhing away theſe ſighes, and drying vp thy too too drerie eies.</p>
               <p>And this (ſweet husband) I require and deſire thee, (nay more) I coniure thee, as thou loueſt me, to lament no more, what cannot be recouered. Once more adue (ſweet <hi>Leander</hi>) I goe before to prepare a place for thee in the heauens, and ſo farewell deare husband.</p>
               <p>Come come, embrace and kiſſe me, to the end that my ſoule (comming forth of bodie) may make his paſſage into thine, which (whileſt I liued) was his earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p>The ſad knight hearing her ſay ſo, embraceth her anew, holding her cloſely in his armes, whileſt death approaching vnto her, ſeazed vpon her, cloſing vp her beautious eies, and leauing her ſenceleſſe coarſe, as cold as any ſtone, which when <hi>Leander</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he ſought all the meanes he could to bring her vnto life againe, although it could not be.</p>
               <p>And as the wilde Beare from whom her whelpes be ſtolen, ſearcheth vp and downe for them, leauing no place vnlooked, and yet (doe what ſhe can) ſhe cannot finde them.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Leander</hi> leaueth no part of his wiues bodie vntouched, to ſee, if he could finde any one ſparke of life in her, but all in vaine, for death had alreadie extended his heauie hand ouer her.</p>
               <p>As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Damaske Roſe being once withered, hath not one greene leaſe about it, but ſuch as be drie, and fallen from their naturall colour: Euen ſo was her bodie without force, or mouing, lying along without any motion or ſence at all.</p>
               <p>And yet although ſhe were dead, ſhe laie as louely, as if ſhe had but bene in a ſmiling ſleepe. No maruaile then, if whileſt ſhe were liuing, ſhe was ſo gratious with All, when (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15406:127"/>dead) ſhe was able to make men fall in loue with her, for the cruell deſtinies were not of power, to take from her the propotion of her beautious viſage, but onely the rare vermillion colour of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But now, how is it poſſible for me to deſcribe (at large) the true ſorrow wherewith her kind husband was poſſeſt by reaſon of her loſſe? It is a taske too great for me to take in hand, and therefore I will giue it ouer, neither meane I, to ſet downe, with what great pompe, and exceeding charges, her funerall obſequiſe were moſt ſolemnely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Onely I will ſpeake a word or two of his end, which was, that after her death, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyed (ſo much) as one ſmal houre, nor liued any long time after her. His chiefeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was to thinke on death, his diet he fed on, was ſighs, teares, ſobs, and lamentings.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he cauſed all his Caſtle to be painted with blacke, mixing here and there white teares amongſt the ſame, neither did he, nor any of his followers, weare other than mourning apparell, as long as he liued. And to conclude, ſo vehement was his paſſions, in his ſorrow, that they brought him into a recureleſſe conſumption, wherein, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not aboue three months but that he died, hauing giuen order (before) to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Monument, that he erected for his conſtant <hi>Cynthia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Tragedie was ſo pittifully deliuered by the well ſpoken Nymph <hi>Orythia,</hi> as ſhe forced all her Auditors to ſhed ſalt teares, eſpecially when ſhe made a concluſion of the ſame, when they perceiuing that the Sunne was downe, began (euery one of them) to withdraw themſelues vnto their proper Lodgings, but ſhe ſtaied them a while, meaning to reuiue their dulled ſpirits, after the hearing of ſo dolefull an Hiſtorie, with this Song following.</p>

               <p>Theſe torments, theſe dreames, theſe labours, and theſe flames, are ſtirring verie earlie. And as the Hare goeth out of her Forme, betimes in the morning, to feede in the corne fieldes, being afraide, leſt (in the day) ſhee ſhould light vpon ſome vnhappie encounter;</p>
               <p>In like manner, the Shepheard can no longer remaine in his Cottage, when hee ſeeth the day dawne, on that ſide of the heauens, where the Sunne riſeth: hee will (by no meanes) that his bright beames ſhould reflect vpon his drouſie head. This would turne him (as he thinketh) to great ſhame, to be diſcouered by the Sunne: And he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the like reproach, as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> receiued, being found together, and taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the induſtrious Net of <hi>Vulcan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſluggard neuer acteth any thing of importance: Glorie is not obtained by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle, but by plying out fingers, buſying our ſelues in manie matters, and ſtyrring (earlie) about our affaires.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:15406:129"/>
               <p>The Sunne yet wet, in riſing from his moyſt bed, let fall certaine droppes vpon the earth, &amp; it ſeemed by his appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ſome flagitious fact by him ſeene, had made him looke all pale, ſad, &amp; heauie: notwithſtanding, by degrees, he euer drew nearer &amp; nearer.</p>
               <p>Oh, what a power hath this goodly Lamp, which giueth life vnto all creatures, keeping and preſeruing the ſame in them, as alſo by the ſame hand, he taketh away, periſheth, and confoundeth the ſame: notwithſtanding, there is no good, how little ſo euer it be, which is not farre better, then the beſt griefes of the world. In like manner, thogh the Sun ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe pale, morphewed, &amp; ghaſtly, yet was hee by all creatures, a 1000. times more deſired then night, how cleare ſoeuer. The clifts euen ſmoaked, with a deſire to ſee and feele his beams vpon their toppes: euen as the furious Bull caſteth fume out of his noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrills, when he ſeeketh after fight, &amp; deſireth to meete with the <hi>Lydian</hi> Lyon, to ſet vpon him. There was not ſo much as the flowers, which ſmiled not at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: they being his beautifull kinſmen, to the end to pleaſe, &amp; ioyfully receiue him. The Birds called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, in their notes, the beaſts, by their ſounds &amp; voyces, &amp; men, by many ſignes and demonſtrations: Deſired therefore, of all liuing creatures, he commeth &amp; ſpreadeth on all ſides his flaming eyes, cauſing all the world to behold his faire &amp; bright countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Euery one beholding the ſame, bluſheth thereat, &amp; is aſhamed: heauen it ſelfe appeareth more neare and cleare, and the Shepheard, conducted by this immortall light, with ſlow pace, arriueth within the Deſarts. He neither draue lambs nor ſheepe before him, for the iniquitie of the time had diſpoyled him of them: robbing him of his bleating troupes, and of whatſoeuer elſe he had receiued by the benefite of <hi>Fortune:</hi> Hee went out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all alone, walking along with an awaked ſpirit &amp; mind, disburdened of all drowſines, all quick, and liuing, whilſt he thus ſaid to himſelfe; It is with ſpeciall reaſon, that men tearme heauen their Father: for in truth without him, what could they performe? Doth not he beſtow on them their being, life, vigour, contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; pleaſure? Whatſoeuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour or bountie men feele, it deſcendeth from aboue. For the earth of it ſelfe, produceth vnto them nothing good or excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but on the contrary, bringeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth a thouſand maladies, cares, torments &amp; labors. And though there tumble down from heauen, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſeries &amp; ſcourges, which torment &amp; whip men, yet neuertheles, their own ſinne is the cauſe thereof. For this is the liuely fountain of malediction, &amp; not heauens: euen as the fountain is no occaſion of the water that harboreth within the ſame, but the ſpring from whence it floweth ſo cold. Is not heauen the nourice of this faire Sun, which ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all things, heateth as well thoſe bodies ſenſible, as other immoueable, &amp; that giueth vertue &amp; power vnto the earth? On the other ſide, within heauen dwelleth the Eternall Deitie, in the ſame is his ſeate, there within is his Empire, &amp; there his diuine Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>In heauen dwelleth this great and mercifull GOD, who doth not only pardon men during their liues, but euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are dead alſo. His mercie walketh ouer the Tombs and Sepulchers of the dead, and goeth ſeeking them out, euen vnder the earth, to relieue them, by his charitable office, giuing vs triall, not onely of admirable Clemencie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of diuine Iuſtice. That which maketh him to be knowne for true God, is only his Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and his Mercie. For hee could not be God, except he were both iuſt and mercifull.</p>
               <p>Beſides, hee moſt liberallie giueth vnto vs wherewith to maintaine our life: hauing a care of the leaſt haires that fall from off our heads, and of the leaſt byrd that liueth. Hee giueth nouriſhment vnto euery one: yea, vnto the Crowes little ones themſelues, that call vpon him, when their olde ones denie to giue them foode at all.</p>
               <p>O an hundred times worthie of infernall puniſhment is hee, who loftie and proud, will not giue thanks vnto God, for ſo manie of his benefites I ſeeing beſides a thouſand others, he might haue iuſt occaſion ſo to doe, for this onely good, in that he hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mankinde to be borne, maiſter of all other creatures, and giuen him a ſoule immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in felicitie. For if the enemies of men be puniſhed and if ſometimes the Ancients ordained equall paine, for one Ingrate, as for a murtherer. Surely, the man ingrate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Almightie God, that acknowledgeth not ſo many bleſſings and graces from him, ought to ſuffer much, as worthie of moſt grieuous puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Thus ſayd the Shepheard to himſelfe, and had further diſcourſed vpon this ſubiect, but that a ſudden ſtorme of raine made him runne out, to goe ſtand vnder a thick Rock, the toppe whereof, ſaue garded him from the iniuries of heauen. And being there aboue,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15406:129"/>he heard a voyce, which vttered this which followeth. Bleſſed be they which are either perfectly happie, without euer hauing felt griefe: or altogether miſerable, hauing neuer made tryall of any contentment. For he which (ſuddainly) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out of the Stoue, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the aire colder, then he (who hauing neuer bene within) hath alwayes ſtood without doore. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, thoſe which neuer felt any good during their life, endure nothing ſo much as they which haue bin happie, &amp; are afterwards becom miſerable. For if white maketh vs better to know and diſcerne black, in like ſort, good maketh the griefe (which enſueth) more cruell &amp; intollerable: the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of which loſſe, terribly tormenteth our ſoules. It greeueth not one ſo much to goe without cloathes, who ordinarily goeth naked, as well in winter as Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer: but it would be a cumberſome &amp; hard matter for him, who hath bin well and warmly clad, to be ſtripped, thruſt into his ſhirt, and forced to go all bare. In like manner, the miſerable that haue knowne nothing but griefe, are not ſo greatly oppreſſed with paine, as they who haue ſometimes taſted of felicitie, whereof at the ſame inſtant, they finde themſelues depriued.</p>
               <p>More cruell was king <hi>Perceus</hi> his change, who of a puiſſant king, became miſerable, a ſeruant, ſlaue, and laughing-ſtocke of <hi>Fortune,</hi> then if hee had neuer knowne any ſuch greatnes, remaining as a priuate ſimple man, and without a Diademe. Of the ſelfe ſame now ſpeake I, by experience, for more cruell at this day doe I feele the griefe, to ſee my ſelfe abſented &amp; depriued of my deare <hi>Diana:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if I had neuer ſeen her, or that ſhe had not pleaſed mine eies, as ſhe hath done. Alas: Can it be that I ſhould remaine without her, or that my ſoule may continue in my body, being depriued of her faire and ſhining countenance? If the bodie cannot moue without the ſoule: Oh how can mine liue, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying no more that Sun which cauſed it both to liue and moue? Oh my <hi>Diana,</hi> in what part ſoeuer thou glau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſt forth thy beautifull and celeſtiall rayes, let the heauens be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fauourable vnto thee, in recompence of the good thou haſt done me, in ſuffering me to behold thy countenance. Farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy yeares &amp; dayes let pale death flie: all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, abſent it ſelfe from thy ſoule: all vexation &amp; griefe auoyd thy hart: &amp; let ſadnes be baniſhed from thence: &amp; to conclude, let no feeling of griefe euer touch thee liuing: let heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies make thy beauty durable, thy chaſt vertue immortall, thy ſacred fidelitie &amp; power, eternall, and thy excellent glorie endles. Alas, if the heauens preſerue thy noble perfections, who vnder the Sun ſhall liue, more perfect or happy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy ſelfe? for none can equall thee in theſe worthie vertues: vertues (alas) which augment misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, &amp; make my complaints more bitter. For he hath greater cauſe to complain, that hath loſt much, then he that hath endured the loſſe but of a ſmall matter. I haue loſt thy diuine preſence, which only chaſed and droue away my obſcure nights: now I wander in darknes, in night, in horror, &amp; vexation. I haue loſt my Sun, &amp; my dayes are turned into nights. (Alas) but haue I not likewiſe loſt my miſerable life? Alas, my Goddeſſe, if thou wouldeſt (if thou wouldeſt I ſay) take my ſoule, &amp; as thine owne, retaine it with thee, why takeſt not thou in like manner my life, cauſing him to die, which cannot liue, remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy light? but I muſt ſcoure both ſea &amp; land to find thee out. I will flie neither paine, danger, nor labor, to ſee thee (yet once more) before death reap my ſad &amp; wretched daies. And then in all repoſe, contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; pleaſure, I will yeeld this miſerable carkaſſe to the earth, ſhaken &amp; quaſhed, with ſo many hitter griefes, &amp; euen broken (as it were in pieces) with a thouſand martyrdoms. During theſe daies repleniſhed with obſcurity, &amp; dyed in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, &amp; darknes. In that I ſhall not behold thy beautifull &amp; diuine countenance, my teares like ſtreams, ſhall poure out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my blubbered eyes, ſighes ſhall come forth, euen from my ſoule, ſad wailing &amp; mourning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my hart. No apprehenſion of pleaſure ſhall dwel within me, no appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of life, to ſigne of pleaſing delights, nor any note of health. Miſerable will I alwaies remaine, no ioyfull accident, no cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of <hi>fortune,</hi> or new forme of life, can adminiſter the leaſt conſolation to my ſoule, voyd of pleaſure &amp; ioy, of all good and contentment. I will ſigh continually, while deſtinie (moued at my long complaints) together with my life, cut off my teares &amp; troubles. Thus ſpake this wretched Shepherd, wretched ſurely, &amp; miſerable, who neuer felt ſo much as one ſmiling glaunce of <hi>fortune,</hi> miſerable (certainly) in that he was borne to ſuffer, &amp; neuer knew what ioy meant: &amp; yet more wretched, in hauing ſpent his years, emploied his whole life, offered his dayes, and yeelded his time to ſeruice of many, who permitted pouertie to ſwallow vp his years, and manage and ouermaiſter his life.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:15406:130"/>
               <p>And though he were peerles in miſerie, and that his ſtate of life, was onely ſwayed by misfortunes, which held him caytif: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, cruel enuie, which biteth all things, though they be incorporeall, ceaſed not to make a thouſand malicious &amp; iealous of that little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, which his dolorous Muſe acquired to his years. In all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations therfore, he was moſt wretched aboue all others. But that which gaue the greateſt blow, and that made his griefe inſupportable, and fell, was the abſence and loſſe of his <hi>Diana.</hi> The remembrance wherof, was ſufficient to forget, choak, &amp; quite extinguiſh all the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall pleaſures he could haue taſted of in this world. Euery one maketh his chiefe felicity, of that he beſt liketh, &amp; things which are ſometimes held for happy &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, are in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt with thoſe, who haue placed their ſoueraigne good in ſome other matter, as Louers flout at riches, treaſures, Empires and kingdomes, which mortall men propound vnto themſelues, for the good of their contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; vpon which, they build their moſt pleaſure and delight. But the onely preſence of their Ladies, is their chiefeſt good: for their ſoules be more ioyfull in beholding of them, then are the eyes of a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous mizer, &amp; when they take pleaſure in contemplation of the goods &amp; riches of <hi>fortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the number of theſe, was this miſerable Shepheard, who ſcoffed at the commodities of that blind goddeſſe, deſiring no other thing for his full ſatisfaction, and delight, then the preſence of his faire <hi>Diana.

Diana,</hi> who took pleaſure in reading of his works, &amp; that neuer ſhewed him frowning countenance, in that ſhe knew he honored her honor, more then her beautie: and that his chaſte loue, loued rather her ſoule and mind, then her bodie. Nothing could hinder ſage and chaſte <hi>Diana</hi> from ſhewing good countenance, &amp; chaſtely louing excellent ſpirits. She ſhould haue bene a cruell Beare, if her ſoule had bene void of amitie: and this learned Queene of <hi>France,</hi> kiſſed learned <hi>Chartier,</hi> finding him a fleeepe, vpon a bancks ſide, though (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all other euill fauoured and deformed) hee was moſt crabbed of countenance: giuing this excellent anſwere to thoſe that wondered at the ſame: I kiſſe not <hi>Chartier,</hi> but that excellent mouth, from whence haue iſſued ſo manie learned diſcourſes, not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the man, but his doctrine: In doing thus, no Ladie can be blamed.

               <p>Teares haue alwaies bene held (for reproach) in noble hearts, magnanimous mindes neuer weepe, they leauing this effeminate and baſe qualitie vnto women. And in verie good conſideration, the victor <hi>Aemilius,</hi> caſt in miſerable <hi>Perceus</hi> his teeth, puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and want of courage, in addicting himſelfe to lamentation, why then doe you weepe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> with a conſtant and cheerfull countenance beheld his childrens death. And that Phyloſopher was no whit at all moued, vnderſtanding of the death of his onely ſonne. In lamentation, Time ſlippeth away, and in the meane while, there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die found to come out of miſerie. There is a double loſſe, the one of our health &amp; quiet, which reares ouer whelme: the other of precious time, which in ſteede of beſtowing of it in complaints, we ſhuld employ in ſearching out proper remedie for our miſeries &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That thing only ſhould be deplored, the which is without recouerie and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But that which may be remedied, ſhould not be lamented, but with diligence ſought out to be recouered. For what can be ouer difficult for men to performe? Are not all things ſubiect vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? and <hi>doth not the wiſe man command ouer the ſtarres?</hi> which is to ſay, he may by his wiſedome, auoid the ſiniſter aſpect of the heauens, make them otherwiſe diſagree of their diſaſtrous Influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? What care moued reſolute <hi>Diogines,</hi> any thing at all? either the cruell blowes of peruerſe fortune, or the terrible conſtellations of heauen? Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he not happy, without ſighes, in his Tunne? By his knowledge he ſurmounted both the ſtarres &amp; fortune. For properly, he may be tearmed victor, that feareth not his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and when he can no wayes iniurie or offend him. And if all men would frame their liues, after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this wiſe man, when ſhuld we heare any ſighes proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them? or what dolour could entangle their repoſe? Nothing wanteth in man to be perfectlie happie, but reſolution. For when he is reſolute to be conſtant in misfortunes, without ſo much as being once moued at the darts of aduerſe fortune, nothing can annoy him, hee remaineth braue and couragious, like the Conqueror within the Lyſtes, againſt whome none dare make further tryall of their force. In like manner, fortune feareth the noble hart, &amp; he (which with a braue reſolution diſpoſeth himſelfe to reſiſt inconſtancie) ſhee dares no further lay hold vpon, but permitteth him a free life, quiet breathing, &amp; happie repoſe. She is like the cocke, who hauing bene well beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an other, and bleeding in all parts of his body, dares not returne to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, but auoideth the pit, &amp; va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed, flieth away. In like manner, reſiſt thou this vniuſt fortune, who hath made vpon thee ſo huge and cruel a warre, &amp; reſolue as a <hi>Marius,</hi> to withſtand misfortunes, without changing thy countenance thereat, more then he did. For mans wiſedome is not diſcerned in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fortune, in that it is an eaſie matter to ſhew himſelfe wiſe &amp; conſtant in his felicities, but rather in aduerſe and contrarie occurrences, the which to ſurmount, valour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and vertue, is requiſite.</p>
               <p>Shepheard, (replyed <hi>Arcas</hi>) I confeſſe, that the loſſe of earthlie thinges, yea, and of the life it ſelfe; ſhould not drawe tears from the eyes of the wiſe, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his heart to ſend forth ſighes. For they be things of ſmall value, &amp; the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sages thought alwayes that they carried their treaſure about with them, in bearing their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: but this doctrine taketh no place in Loue. Euery thing hath alwaies ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the very threatnings of the eternall God, chaunge oftentimes, and ſaueth ſome one or other. So (notwithſtanding, we may iuſtly maintaine, that teares &amp; ſighes are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming a valiant and noble man) yet muſt wee alwayes ſay, except onely in amorous actions. For the Gods, Goddeſſes, and the <hi>Heroes,</hi> haue lamented in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Venus</hi> bewaile her deare <hi>Adonis,</hi> mouing to pitty therewith, euen things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life? did not <hi>Apollo</hi> lament his <hi>Daphne?</hi> did not <hi>Hercules</hi> mourne for his wife, which the <hi>Centaure</hi> took away from him? did not cruell <hi>Achilles</hi> bewaile his <hi>Briſais?</hi> did not <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſes</hi> the wiſe, take on for his wife? and that <hi>Palladine</hi> of <hi>France, Orlando</hi> the Frenchmens honor? did he not a thouſand times bewaile his <hi>Angelica,</hi> becomming furious &amp; madde, in that hee had loſt her? hath not braue <hi>Renaldo,</hi> and all thoſe valiant Heroicall ſpirits made moane? whoſe complaints wiſe and mellifluent <hi>driostus</hi> reporteth vnto as?</p>
               <p>O (Shepheard) why art thou then aſtoniſhed, if I bewaile and grieue, for my ſacred <hi>Diana?</hi> the fire of loue like thunder, which neuer commeth without raine, although of it ſelfe it be burning fire, and hotely kindeled. In like manner, the flames of Loue are alwayes mingled with lamentations and teares. For Loue oftentimes forgeth his fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15406:131"/>of contraries, that is, of Loue (oftentimes) and of hatred, both mixt together. Experience giueth teſtimonie of the ſame: For onely Louers lament and are ſadde, when they are not beloued, but hated of their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>And behold, euen as the thunder is engendred of heate, and cold, ſo be the flames of Loue compounded, of loue and hatred: ſo that it is vnpoſſible for the Louer to loue, except he be beloued againe: but bewaile, and lament he may, becauſe theſe contraries proceed from him, and render diuers effects, of their ſorme. Why wonder you therefore, that I weepe?</p>
               <p>Oh Shepheard, he which ſoweth vpon the Sea, ſand, ſpendeth not his time more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, then he which beſtoweth it in ſearching remedie for his Loue. For what can enforce an heart of Diamond, or a loftie, proud, and cruell dame, to loue againſt her will? Violence in this thing is forbidden, and though law would permit it, yet would liuely and loyall Loue hinder it. For the Louer will neuer doe any thing (though he may) which ſhall be diſpleaſing to his Miſtreſſe: all meanes of remedie ceaſing, we muſt (neceſſarily) haue remorſe to lamentation and teares, which be the armes of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, crying out of the iniuſtice, and crueltie of the Starres, which make vs loue, the thing that hateth vs, and to deſire the thing that flieth and ſhunneth vs. And if the wiſe (as thou ſaiſt) ouercame, and ſurmounted the diuers aſſaults of Fortune, I anſwere thee withall,</p>
               <p>That Loue hath tamed them, as well as my ſelfe: and none can make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Let <hi>Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and that prudent King endued with the gift of wiſedome beare witnes: I will no more therefore thinke my ſelfe fooliſh, or depriued of reaſon in louing, ſeeing theſe great lights (as well as my ſelfe) haue by Loue bene darkned; &amp;, that theſe Sages haue trodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the path of my error. But Shepheard (replied <hi>Coribant</hi>) if ſome haue offended, will you conclude, that by their example, euery one may erre? And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the auncient Sages, ſome haue bene fooles, and deceiued by Loue, will you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that others haue yeelded themſelues to this inconuenience? You ſhould in this doe them great iniurie, for all the Iewes (for the moſt part) were wicked, and yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, being of the ſelfe ſame nation, were good men. The cruell daughters of <hi>Danaut,</hi> killed their husbands: but pittifull <hi>Hypermuestra,</hi> (that ſaued hers) muſt not be put in the number of theſe bloodie ſiſters. In like manner, a thouſand learned perſonages, which haue not onely ſubdued Loue, but euen the ſtarres themſelues, ought not to be taxed of reproach, becauſe there were ſome amongſt them, ſuffered themſelues to be tranſported away with this furie: for the vice of one particular man, obligeth not a generalitie to the blame which he onely deſerueth: and an othres offence, cannot preiudice the innocent. If <hi>Plate</hi> haue erred, wiſe <hi>Aristetle</hi> ſtumbled, &amp; Sage <hi>Salomon</hi> gone aſtray, will you ſay (for all this) that diuine <hi>Socrates,</hi> wiſe &amp; graue <hi>Cato,</hi> &amp; prudent <hi>Moſes,</hi> haue bene ſinners, and plunged in the ſelfe ſame vice: and, if the former be not to be followed, nor imitated, take example by the ſecond, doing like the wiſe Apothecarie; who extracteth the iuice and vertue of hearbes, and afterwards caſteth away that which is worth nothing.</p>
               <p>Fuen ſo, amongſt the Ancients, we muſt imitate thoſe, whoſe excellent actions may ſerue in ſtead of a guide, &amp; patterne, leauing this, who, in imitating of them, may cauſe vs ſtumble into the pit of vice: in which, they be drowned and waſhed: You conclude not well therefore, in drawing a libertie of doing euill from an other mans vice: but on the contrarie, our neighbours error, muſt ſerue vs in ſteed of a darke night, wherein, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame, to kindle our owne vertue, muſt ſhine bright, inſtructing our ſelues, by his famous example, as the ancient Spartaines cauſed their ſlaues to be made drunke, to the end that their children might hate wine, by the brutiſh, and diſhoneſt actions they ſawe theſe baſe creatures commit, being poſſeſſed with this liquor.</p>
               <p>It is a fooliſh concluſion to ſay, that if my neighbour be a foole, I muſt therefore become inſenſate, and ſet fire on my owne houſe, becauſe I ſee my neighbours on a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flame: It is rather requiſite, that an other mans doing be beneficiall vnto vs, and that the vice of our neighbour, reforme our owne, and not make vs to offend like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For vertue would be imitated, and vice auoided.</p>
               <p>To maintaine that no man can be conſtant and reſiſt Loue, were to erre groſely: For <hi>Alexander</hi> amidſt his great victories, delights and conqueſts, performed it.</p>

               <p>Oh Shepheard (replied <hi>Arcas</hi>) I denie the foundation of your argument: for I will not confeſſe that it is a fault or crime to loue, and iudge Louers no leſſe wiſe, then thoſe that haue not loued at all: for he may iuſtly be ſaid to be peruerſe and an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whoſe offence procureth publike dammage, but (ſo farre of) is a Louer from preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing men, that quite contrarie he profiteth them greatly.</p>
               <p>The Louer (like the prodigall man) iniureth none but himſelfe: he onely beareth, he onely endureth, he onely ſuffereth: but from his torment ariſeth mortall glorie to the ſubiect he loueth: for was there euer Ladie faithfully by her ſeruant beloued, that did not both honour and ſing forth (according to the abilitie of his inuention) her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and rare vertues.</p>
               <p>What can mortall men deſire more deare and precious, then to ſee themſelues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and made immortall to future ages, the which Louers fauoured by the Muſes, may make their Ladies and Miſtreſſes? That great King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> thought he not <hi>Achilles</hi> happie, to haue bene ſet forth and commended by <hi>Homor?</hi> and all great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, haue they not deſired the like honour? Not to be moued with the paſſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is to be brutiſh and without feeling, or not to be ſtirred vp with a deſire to make ones name liuing after death, is a ſigne of a baſe and booriſh minde.

               <p>But it is certaine, that the Muſes hauing taken Loue in a ſnare of flowers, would ſay nothing elſe, but crowne this God, with greene garlands, acknowledging, that they ſhould be nothing without him, who giueth them vttrance, power, &amp; breath, to ſet forth their verſes, in deſpite of time it ſelfe: For neither <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Fuen ſo, let me intreate thee, to diſpatch, and giue thy verdit of life or death againſt me, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting thy ſelfe any longer in my Diſaſters. The fire put into the mouth of a Cannon, forceth the pouder to flie out ſuddenly, which turneth into a flame: Euen ſo, I am not able longer to endure, without my griefe burſt forth of my ſoule, or that I giue vp the ghoſt and die.</p>
               <p>But what talke I of death, when it is denied vnto me? No no, had I but had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the ſame, thou (cruell man) hadſt neuer heard ſo many praiers come from me, neuer had I made ſo many vowes vnto thee, neither had I moued thee ſo often vnto compaſſion as I haue done: for with ſome deſperate inſtrument or other, I had finiſhed both my life and griefe long ere this, and both at one time.</p>
               <p>But (alas) I (being immortall) muſt endure this anguiſh, whileſt being able to helpe others, I cannot heale mine owne feſtring wounds. Not vnlike the Phyſition, who dieth after he hath conſerued the liues of other, not hauing the skill to preſerue his owne. Were ſome God the cauſe of theſe my plaints, and that by reaſon of ſome one Deitie or other, this miſchaunce had hapned vnto me, I were not worthie of ſome excuſe amongſt mine equals.</p>
               <p>But when I call to minde, how I haue ſuffered my ſelfe to be vanquiſht by a ſimple Shepheard, and yet am not able to perſwade him to haue remorſe vpon me, I needs muſt confeſſe I am worthie to be blamed, and that rightly. But alas, I know not wel what I ſay, for my Ladie the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> loueth a Shephcard as well as I, and vnder this weede oftentimes lodgeth, vertue, learning, and beautie.</p>
               <p>Neuer was any more beautifull than <hi>Adonis,</hi> none more faire than <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and none more liuely than <hi>Paris,</hi> when he was a Shepheard, neither was there euer a Nymph more amiable than <hi>Enone</hi> the Shepheardeſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angelica,</hi> the peerleſſe Paragon of all beautie, left many great Princes, and valiant <hi>Paladines</hi> (all which were ſuters vnto her for her Loue) and accepted a poore common Souldier for her ſweet heart and Loue. Loue reſpecteth not riches, onely he hath an eie vnto the perfection of the perſon that is loued.</p>
               <p>Then (ſweet Shepheard) fancie me, and giue me ſome ſure proofe, of thy affection towards me, without putting me any more to further troubles.</p>
               <p>So ſaid the penſiue Nymph, when <hi>Arcas,</hi> being rauiſhed with the contemplation of his faire Miſtris, as if he had bene ſpeaking vnto her, and as if <hi>Orythia,</hi> had bene farre from him. Began to ſpeake thus.</p>
               <p>O ſacred <hi>Diana,</hi> haue I not as yet giuen thee ſufficient teſtimonie of my zealous good will towards thee, conſidering my long and many ſorrowes, but wilt thou ſtill ſee more, and yet neuer yeeld me, any recompence for the ſame?</p>
               <p>Alas, the Goldſmith trieth gold but once, if it will indure the fire, which he vſeth to make ſo me excellent piece of worke withall: and the Eagle is contented to carrie his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones but once againſt the Sunnie Beames, which if they are able to abide, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to liue, making account they are his owne. Why then (deare Miſtris) art not thou content with theſe many proofes of my faithfull Amitie, without demaunding (ſtill) new at my hands? If it be, becauſe I am too baſe a creature to be beloued, and that thou thinkeſt me not worthie of ſo high a fauour;</p>
               <p>Ah then, I beſeech thee remember <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who diſdained not the Loue of <hi>Europe,</hi> or of <hi>Semele,</hi> although they were mortall women, nor <hi>Thetis,</hi> who (although a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) yet vouchſafed to eſpouſe <hi>Penelus,</hi> an earthly man, and ſacred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> who vouchſafed to affect the <hi>Troyan Caſſandra;</hi> yea, remember the Goddeſſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15406:133"/>of all beautie, who was willing to accept the Loue of <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> &amp; to beare a child by him, which was called the wandring Prince <hi>Aeneas.</hi> And therefore, be not angrie, although I dare to loue thee, for I feare not that the torment of <hi>Ixion</hi> ſhall euer puniſh me, becauſe I honour thee, in as much as my loue, is neither diſhoueſt, beaſtly, nor viticus, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacred, vertuous, and chaſte, and therefore not ſubiect to any reprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Why, doeſt thou thus oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt that faire glorie which thy worthy carriage doth permit? why doeſt thou reiect that praiſe, which euery one would render vnto thy peerleſſe beautie? why doeſt thou diſdaine that honour which the heauens haue ordained for thy matchleſſe perfection? And why doeſt thou refuſe the ſeruice of the moſt loyalleſt Louer that euer breathed? In times paſt thoſe beautifull Ladies counted themſelues happie, that could vant themſelues, of the faithfulnes of their Louers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hero,</hi> thought her ſelfe fortunate, in that ſhe had <hi>Leander,</hi> for her faithfull friend: and why then doeſt thou denie to be moſt faithfully ſerued of thy deuoted and true hearted <hi>Arcas?</hi> Suffer him, ſuffer him (hard-harted as thou art) to honour thee, for the Gods themſelues forbid not men (although vitious) to adore them, becauſe friendſhip is not to be ſcorned from whence ſoeuer it commeth, in that it proceedeth from a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and well-wiſhing minde.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid the Shepheard, when the Nymph hearing him to make this ſtraunge kinde of Tale, purſued her former complaint in this manner. Ah barbarous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull man, why doeſt thou ſtop thine eares againſt my pralers?</p>
               <p>Take heed, take heed, leaſt the heauens (iuſtly puniſhing thee) harden not the hart of her whom thou honoureſt, againſt thee, as thou moſt vnkindly haſt done vnto me: for (oftentimes) we fall into the ſnare which we haue laid to intrappe ſtraungers, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcourged with the ſame plague wherewith we haue afflicted others. Is it not enough for thee to be contented with theſe my ſorrowes, but that thou muſt mocke mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, making a ſhew as if thou ſaweſt another and not me, vnto whom thou frameſt thy ſpeech? But the Gods be iuſt, and therefore thanked be they, ſeeing thy Miſtris ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee know (and that vnto thy coſt, if thou ſo much loueſt, as thou makeſt vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) how inſupportable the torments are, which thy Sauadge rigor maketh me to feele, for he onely can talke rightly of griefe, that hath felt the ſame, and daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence maketh vs perfect in the knowledge of ſuch things as we practiſe.</p>
               <p>If thou feeleſt this euill, and if thou knoweſt how full of anguiſh it is, then permit not me to abide the ſame any longer, which if thou doeſt, thou wilt then force me to call for aide vnto the heauens, that they aſſiſt me, to take reuengement vpon thee; for he ought (and that iuſtly) to be puniſhed, who knoweth the euell that he doth, is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the greatnes of the fault he committeth, and yet (neuerthele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le) will not giue it ouer: for onely ignorance excuſeth the offence, which knowledge condemneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as did perpetrate the ſame, were not vnacquainted with it: Open then, thoſe deafe eares of thine, and ſhew me ſome pittie, to the intent, I may commend thee for kindnes, as long as the world ſhall flouriſh.</p>
               <p>The Shepheard (notwithſtanding theſe her earneſt perſwaſions) ſeemed not to heare one word, but as he did at the firſt, ſo ſtill he continued, making ſolemne interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto his good Angell <hi>Diana,</hi> in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>Alas, muſt the diſtance of place, hinder thee (faire Virgin) ſo much, as thou canſt not aunſwere me? and muſt I be ſo miſerable, as I may ſay, I am farre exiled from thee?</p>
               <p>Can my ſoule breathe and not behold thee? O wonderfull miracle, that wretched <hi>Arcas</hi> can liue without the chaſte and prudent <hi>Diana;</hi> for ſhe is his ſoule, and the bodie without ſoule, how is it poſſible that it ſhould ioy at all? Certainely, I ſhould thinke my ſelfe much bleſſed, if I might but onely ſee thy face, without ſpeaking as much as one word vnto thee, for then would I moſt willingly yeeld vnto death: but I ſee it is my deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to die, and not ſo much as before my death to ſee thee.</p>
               <p>Vnfortunate, my Tombe to be ſo farre off from thee (my deare) and accurſed mine eies, to ſleepe in any other reſting place, than where thou abideſt.</p>
               <p>But alas, art thou the cauſe of my diſtreſſe? no no, it is the heauens, who are ouer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15406:134"/>iealous of my glorie, and who would faine loue thee themſelues, they knowing thy like is not to be found in the whole world: and therefore are the more vnwilling to haue any Corriuals in their Loue. But in deſpite of them, will I loue thee, nothing being of force to quench this outragious heate of mine, no, not death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus wailed the ſad Shepheard, thinking verily that he had bene before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his diuine <hi>Diana,</hi> and more would he haue lamented, but that <hi>Coribant</hi> plucking him by the ſleeue, and wearied with hearing him (and the amorous <hi>Orythia</hi>) put him out of this amorous dreame in this ſort.</p>
               <p>Enougn (man) enough, no teares nor ſighes make a man the wiſer, after the fault committed; but rather more miſerable and wretched.</p>
               <p>Ceaſe I ſay, ceaſe, both of you to lament, and rather ſeeke ſome remedie how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe your ſorrowes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arcas</hi> and <hi>Orythia</hi> ſeeing there was no remedie, conſidering the foulnes of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſat them downe, when <hi>Coribant,</hi> ſitting betwixt them (and they lending a liſtning eare vnto him) began his dolorous diſcourſe in this manner.</p>

                  <l>That in the end (and ſuddenly) he carrieth her away,</l>

                  <l>With naked ſword in hand he runnes, after the Thiefe amaine,</l>

                  <l>For ſo faſt tripps the Satire, as it ſeemeth he doth flie,</l>
                  <l>The Eagle faster takes not flight, when he from <hi>Ioue</hi> doth hie.</l>

                  <l>He followeth him apace, and (ſtill) he keepes where he hath tras't,</l>
                  <l>And (more he heares her to lament) the more he maketh haſt.</l>
                  <l>Yet, though he doth all he can, he cannot him ore take,</l>
                  <l>Which is the cauſe his breaſt he beates, and ſorrow great doth make.</l>
                  <l>And now hard at his heeles he is, which when the Satire ſees,</l>

                  <l>So long he ſeekes, that at the laſt he comes into the roome,</l>
                  <l>Where as the Satire, gainſt her will, the Virgin would ore come.</l>
                  <l>Which ſight, incenſt him ſo with rage, as that his ſword he takes,</l>

                  <l>The frighted Nymph, he comforteth, and bids her be of cheare,</l>
                  <l>Since that the Satire (for his raſh attempt) had paid ſo deare.</l>
                  <l>He wils her thanks the God of Loue, who had him thither ſent,</l>
                  <l>Her to protect from villanie, which was againſt her ment.</l>
                  <l>Nor looketh he, for praiſe of her, but happier thinkes himſelfe,</l>

                  <l>Thus ſaid the Shepheard to the Nymph, but (thus) although he ſaid,</l>

                  <l>She ſhooke like an <hi>Aſpen</hi> leafe, her hart did throb and pant,</l>

                  <l>Reſembling right a prettie Hinde, by Hounds that being chaſt,</l>

                  <l>She viewes the Satire, wallowing in his owne blood deſperately,</l>

                  <l>Once more begins to comfort her, and thus he doth begin.</l>
                  <l>Sweet Nymph, what meanſt thou thus to doubt, and why thy ſelfe doſt wrong,</l>

                  <l>The Nymph, now come vnto herſelfe, begins to gather hart,</l>

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:15406:141"/>
               <p>Beautious Shepheardeſſe, euerie thing (excepting thy ſelfe onely) freely exerciſe their <hi>LOVE:</hi> what? is thy ſoule (alone) made of Ice, or thy heart framed of Steele? Which way can it hinder thee to loue mee, ſeeing I haue giuen thee ſo many proofes of my more then common fidelitie, and faithfull conſtancïe towards thee? Wilt thou be the onely Shee in the world, that ſhall liue without louing? Why, the ſacred Muſes themſelues (haue loued,) and <hi>Caliope</hi> her ſelfe, did beare, and bring forth a childe.</p>
               <p>What God is there that can forbid and prohibite to Loue, when they themſelues firſt gaue preſidents vnto men, to follow the ſame? Hee is not to be blamed, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the inſtructions of his Lord, and (to his power) doeth imitate his maiſter in what he doeth.</p>
               <p>Loue then, and if not, as a mortall creature, yet at the leſt doe it, as the Gods haue done before thee. For he deſerueth not to be tearmed a true and loyall ſeruant vnto his Maiſter, that taketh a quite contrarie courſe, vnto that which he teacheth him, as if he would oppoſe himſelfe againſt him, for the very nonce.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible thou ſhouldeſt (ſo long) hate him, who loueth thee ſo dearely? And wilt thou be longer in making me ſome recompence, then thoſe two bretheren of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> were, who ſaued that Poet, which ſung their praiſes all abroad? Speake then, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie me, ſeeing the Gods, (although they be puiſſant and mightie) diſdaine not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere men, by the mouth of their Oracles.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I anſwere vnto thee Shepheard (replyed <hi>Delia</hi>) but that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for anie creature (<hi>LOVE</hi> onely excepted) to make one loue, againſt their owne mindes. <hi>Hippolitus</hi> (for all the prayers and intreating, which <hi>Phoedra</hi> vſed vnto him) could neuer be moued to fancie her: Neither could <hi>Daphne,</hi> for all <hi>Apollos</hi> perſwaſions, be induced to loue him. No, no, <hi>LOVE</hi> is a piercing dart, not throughly knowne of mortall men, which oftentimes without reaſon, vrgeth vs to affect that that is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of our Amitie.</p>
               <p>Be not there many Louers, that if one ſhould demaund of them the cauſe of their Loue, they knowe not what to ſay, nor can alledge anie reaſonable excuſe for the ſame? I know there be.</p>
               <p>How manie Blowſes be there, which are preferred before ſuch as be beautifull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? And how many baſe and beaſtly fellows, before right braue and generous Spirits? What is the occaſion of this diſorder, none can tell: Onely they will ſay, it is the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Cupid,</hi> it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <p>Then thinkeſt thou with thy often ſpeeches, to compell me to loue thee? and doeſt thou ſuppoſe, that without the power of <hi>Loue,</hi> I can be moued to beare thee any affection? If ſo thou doeſt, thou art in the wrong, and therefore trouble <hi>Lone</hi> no more, but rather let him take ſuch courſe, as he ſhall thinke beſt: without ſeeking any more to conſtraine him, againſt his diuine pleaſure. For if he be able to take downe the Gods, much more is he to conquere thee, by forcing thee to follow his will, and to condeſcend vnto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſhall commaund thee.</p>
               <p>Alas (anſwered <hi>Coribant</hi>) fewe diſeaſed perſons there be, that doe not complaine for griefe, (ingendred of ſighes) they being his forerunners, and meſſengers, to manifeſt the ſame abroad. Doeſt thou imagine that I am able to ſupport this ſorrowe, which I feele in liking thee, and that I can conceale the ſame, without making thee acquainted with the tediouſnes thereof?</p>
               <p>But I ſee for all I complaine, yet I find ſmall comfort, (for mortall men cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all they couet of the Gods:) Yet neuertheles, I will diſcharge my conſcience vnto thee, which hath enioyned me to manifeſt this my ſo great euill, to the end I might ſee if I could finde any remedie, to make it whole againe.</p>
               <p>But (ſayeſt thou) <hi>LOVE</hi> is not purchaſt with teares nor plaintes, neither with ſighing nor ſobbing, but muſt come of his owne proper minde, and when he pleaſeth. What is this thou ſayeſt, (vnkinde as thou art) wilt thou denie, that perſeuerance in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant liking, is the mother of <hi>LOVE?</hi> If ſmall drops of water, by often falling, doe make hollowe the Stone; And if rough and ruſtie yron is made ſmoothe and bright, with often handling of the ſame; Why then, wilt thou not in like manner alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that vnfained, long prayers, vowes, plaints, and loyall offices of Fidelitie, are able to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15406:142"/>make a breach in the heart of a Ladie, through which Loue may enter.</p>
               <p>Such hard-harted women, as neither the teares of their Louers can mollifie or appeaſe, neither their complaints moue to pittie, neither their ſecret and faithfull ſeruice, perſwade them to affection, nor their extreame miſeries, reduce them to any compaſſion at all; are farre worſe then Sauadge Beares, denouring Lions, or raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Wolues, that liue in barbarous deſarts: many wilde Beaſtes, in ſteed of ſwallowing and deuouring of men, which haue falne into their pawes, to aſſwage their greedie hunger, in ſteed of praying vpon them, haue cheriſhed and made much of them, and ſhall a woman (by natute gentle and mild) be accounted leſſe pittifull then bruite Beaſtes?</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou thinke that it is an offerice to loue? If all ſuch Ladies which <hi>Iupiter</hi> loued, had giuen him the repulſe as thou doeſt me, the world ſhould yet be full of Monſters, ſpoyled with Tyrants, and ouerthrowne with bad and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>But theſe courteous women, entertaining that great God, with all kindneſſe that might be, brought forth many Demigods, and heroicall Spirits, who moſt brauely purged the world from theſe hatefull and damned Monſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olympia,</hi> the mother of that great <hi>Alexander,</hi> receiued into her boſome that mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> conceiuing by him that glorious Sonne, and that great Monarch of the earth. <hi>Rbea,</hi> the mother of <hi>Remus,</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> refuſed not the kiſſings of God <hi>Mars,</hi> being big with child, of thoſe two worthy Princeſſe, which built <hi>Rome,</hi> afterward, ſhe comming to be Miſtris ouer all the world.</p>
               <p>Away then with theſe fond conceits, and remember, to be fauourable vnto me, as theſe courteous dames haue bene heretofore.</p>
               <p>Shepheard, Shepheard (aunſwered <hi>Delia</hi>) neuer dreame of any ſuch thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and me, for thoſe women yeelded vnto the Gods, becauſe they might bring forth children worthy of ſuch Fathers, which might be as profitable vnto the publike God, as they themſelues had bene before.</p>
               <p>But ſuch a commoditie, cannot happen of our Loue (and ſay it might chaunce to be ſo) yet my opinion is (according vnto the common ſaying) that we ought not doe Euill, that good may come thereof: becauſe the ill being once done, cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: whereas we we are not ſure, whether that good, which we expect, will fall out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto our hopes or no, and the rather, becauſe many things happen betweene the cup and the lip.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe preſidents ſhall neuer perſwade me to loue, for none are bound to follow that which is leaud or bad, neither are they commaunded to be wicked, after the examples of others. Then Shepheard, change thou thy minde, thine owne ſelfe, or elſe thou wilt force me to ſhun thy companie, for there is nothing that troubleth the eares of another more, then to repeate often that which is pleaſing vnto him.</p>
               <p>Remember the torments of <hi>Ixion,</hi> for affecting the iealous Siſter of <hi>Ioue,</hi> and thinke how poore <hi>Tamirus</hi> was plagued, for being amorous of the Muſes: neither goe about to debaſh a chaſte minde to caſt liking vnto thee, for feare leaſt the heauens, who puniſh all ſuch wrongs as are done vnto Innocents, reuenge not this iniurie which thou offereſt vnto me, ſeeing that he is in more fault, that perſwadeth one to leaudnes, then he that doth the ſame, the firſt, inuenting that which (had not he bene had neuer bene done) whereas the other, doth but put in practiſe, what he neuer (of himſelfe) had ment.</p>
               <p>Quench then and mortifie within thee thy fooliſh deſires, and let me alone (I pray thee) to liue as I haue done, who haue bene offered but too much wrong alreadie, without hauing need of thee to buz ſuch vaine toyes into my head, as thou doeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coribant</hi> would haue aunſwered, when he might perceiue hard at hand, the reuerend old man (protector of that Deſart) hauing a ſtaffe in one hand, and a booke in an other, with which, he controuled the Spirits, as well of the earth below, as of the aire aboue.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:15406:142"/>
               <p>He came to finde melancolike <hi>Arcas,</hi> to the end he might follow and proſecute his amorous Hiſtorie, whom he no ſooner eſpied with <hi>Orythia</hi> (who was all this while cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him) but that he marched towards him: which the Nymph perceiuing, left him, when the (Magitian making a ſigne) poore <hi>Arcas</hi> followed him, he not daring to denie him, whereupon they went vnto their accuſtomed place, where being ſet downe, the old man thus began.</p>
               <p>Come on Shepheard, and now begin thy Tale, which the other day thou lefteſt vnperfect, for it is to no end to take a buſines in hand, except we finiſh the ſame.</p>
               <p>Diſpatch I pray thee, and let me heare what thou canſt ſay more, as concerning thy chaſte Loues, for ſweete is the memorie of things commendable, the recitall of which, purgeth our ſoules from many faults, which otherwiſe we are likely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p>Happie are ſuch, as haue had the friendſhip of good and excellent Poets, and ſo likewiſe, vnfortunate are they, that chaunce to fall into their hatred. For, of the firſt, they make the memorie and remembrance euerlaſting, and eternall, asthey make the laſt to be counted hatefull and deteſtable; for ſo doe the writings of the auncient Poets ſhew vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer,</hi> bringeth <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the Greekes to be victors, although it was the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that had the vpper hand, making <hi>Penelope</hi> to be the Mirrour of chaſtitie and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when indeed, ſhe was no better then an infamous Curtezan: and <hi>Virgil</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the traitor <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when the very truth is, he like a diſloyall wretch, ſold <hi>Troy:</hi> and condemneth modeſt <hi>Dido,</hi> to make the world to hate her, ſhe being as free from any ſuch laſcionſnes, as <hi>Maro</hi> was, from telling what was true.</p>
               <p>Happie therefore are ſuch, as learned Poets fauour with their pennes, but aboue all, moſt fortunate are thoſe, whom thou haſt taken in hand to praiſe, becauſe thy Muſe is veritable and not a liar, or vntrue.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed are thoſe, thy beautious Ladies, whoſe worthie vertues thou haſt blazed forth, with ſo great reſpect and reuerence; ſince the memorie of them, ſhall neuer periſh, by reaſon of deuouring time, or be drowned in the pitchy Riner of forgetfull <hi>Lethes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Goe forward then, for the ſoule that is dallied withall, deferred from hope, is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly afflicted with ſorrow, and the hinderance of that thing which one deſireth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the conceit of the ioy, to be farre leſſe, than otherwiſe it would be.</p>
               <p>Great is the charge thou laieſt vpon me (replied <hi>Arcas</hi>) and hardly would I take ſuch a peece of worke in hand for any other, but the law willeth, that he that receiueth, muſt render againe: neither is it ſufficient for one to be beholding vnto another, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he make ſome ſatisfaction for the ſame: and therefore, ſeeing I am in this predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is but reaſon, that I ſhould endeuour to acquit my ſelfe towards thee, in ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy deſire, becauſe I am ſo much bound vnto thee.</p>
               <p>And yet (before I goe any further) I beſeech thee (graue Father) and all ſuch as ſhall come after thee, vnto whom this worke by fortune ſhall happen, to beleeue, that I haue not declined from the truth, in any one word, in deſcribring the rare perfections of <hi>IVLIETTA,</hi> and of <hi>DIANA,</hi> they being ſuch as I haue painted forth, or rather farre more excellent then I am able to diſplay.</p>
               <p>And therefore let the Poſterities hereafter beleeue (as we at this day doe) that as there was a braue and valiant <hi>Harpalice,</hi> that as <hi>Thomaris,</hi> ſometimes raigned, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited the vanquiſher of Kings; that as <hi>Pentiſilea,</hi> gaue ſuccour and aſſiſtance vnto the Troyans, that as Sage and couragious <hi>Zenobia</hi> liued, with thouſands of other peerleſſe women: So was their flouriſhing <hi>IVLIETTA</hi> and <hi>DIANA,</hi> two Ladies and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, of ſo excellent and exquiſit qualities, as well of the bodie as the minde, as neuer any of their Sex, in the old time, are to be compared vnto them.</p>
               <p>But to come to the purpoſe: If you remember, I preſented certaine verſes vnto my ſugred Saint (for ſo I told you) and ſhe accepting of them, went with the other Nymphs towards the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> Follow her I durſt not, for thoſe ſecret ceremonies were forbidden to be ſolemnized by men; whilſt ſhe in the meane ſpace carried away my hart with her, to ſtand her in ſteed of a ſacrifice, which ſhe might offer vnto her Goddeſſe.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:15406:143"/>
               <p>Long did I expect her comming back againe; and grieuous was it vnto me, to ſtay ſo long her returne: but there was no other remedie; wherefore I laid me downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a broade Beech Tree; where, if I had heard neuer ſo ſmall a noyſe, I preſently ſtarted vp, thinking I ſhould haue beheld the ſweet face, and comely countenance of my glorious Sunne.</p>
               <p>If but a ſmall leafe had moued, I thought ſtraightwayes ſhe was come. Then would I count in my minde, how many paces it was from that place vnto the Temple, and me thought that now ſhe was comming from thence, &amp; that (by my account) ſhe was ſo farre onward of the way, and and yet I was deceiued in my conceit. For I reckoned (as they ſay) without mine Hoaſt.</p>
               <p>One while I doubted leaſt ſhe had altered her iourney, and that ſhe determined to walke ſome other way. Another while, I feared leaſt ſhe ſtayed the longer, becauſe ſhe was loth to come where I was.</p>
               <p>O moſt weetched is the condition and eſtate of Louers, from whome, doubtfull feare, and fearefull doubt, can neuer be abandoned. Although men owe reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gods, and that they ought to reſpect that Seruice, as they ſhould their owne proper liues: Yet neuertheleſſe, I could (as then) haue bene very well contented that <hi>Diaxa,</hi> had bene ſpared from doing that Sacrifice. O miſerable lawe of <hi>LOVE,</hi> which ſpoyleth all other, and which (ſo that itſelfe may reſtaliue, and goe for currant) careth not although all other conſiderations be made voyde and diſanulled, how iuſt ſoeuer they be.</p>
               <p>The Louer, ſo hee may enioy what he coueteth, he forgetteth all that is to come, not ſo much as once thinking of the dutie which is due vnto the Gods, nor regarding the feare of men, nor reſpecting ſacred Religion at all.</p>
               <p>Great is the Furie (no doubt) that haunteth them: elſe would not amorous <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> haue ſought the death of innocent <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> neither the wife of <hi>Putiphar,</hi> gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to haue made the vertuous <hi>Ioſeph</hi> endure ſo great miſerie.</p>

This was the cauſe I could not take any reſt quietly, my minde ſtill running, that I was not ſo much fauoured, nor affected, as this new commer was: Not vnlike vnto him, who lying in a wood, cannot ſleepe all that night long, as well becauſe he feareth the rauenous teeth of the wild beaſtes, as alſo, the cruell ſpoyling of fierce and murthering theeues.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, I began to comfort me at the laſt, thinking that if this new come gueſt had bene ſo well entertained by my Saint, he would not then haue lamented ſo much as he did; for one cheerfull looke, one louely glaunce, or one pleaſant word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his Miſtris, is enough to make a Louer reuiue againe, although he were before at deaths doore.</p>
               <p>This then, was the reaſon, that for a while, I was pacified and contented; but then by and by, I began to doubt againe, remembring, that it was an ordinarie courſe of Louers, to complaine without cauſe; whether it is, becauſe ſtill they haue one thing or another in their heads, that maketh the alwaies feare the worſe, or whether it be, for that they take a kind of pleaſure in complaining and lamenting, after they haue glutted themſelues with delight, no otherwiſe than ſuch as (being extreame and hot) fling themſelues into cold water, or as vnto ſtaruen and famiſht men, victuals and food are moſt ſweet and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>This was the perplexitie in which I was in, I being ſo troubled in my minde, as I was halfe out of my wits, yet in the end I reſolued to drawe neere vnto this Shepheard, &amp; to behold him wiſtly, hoping (that when I had throughly marked his contenance) I might quickly coniecture of his diſgrace, or contentment, and whether he were in fauour with my Miſtris or no. Whereupon I ſtole faire and ſoftly vnto him (as with ſlowe and ſecret pace, <hi>Mirrha,</hi> approached the bed of her father) when being hard by him (who lay along at the foote of a ſhadowing Rocke) I might here him demaund his fortune of God <hi>Pan,</hi> who vſed to aunſwere Louers, out of the mouth of certaine enchaunted Rocks. Thus then he began, vnto whom an <hi>Ecco</hi> replied, in this ſort.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Well may you (reuerend Sir) imagine, if this aunſwere was pleaſing vnto me, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull vnto him, eſpecially when he heard the Gods of the Forreſts to be ſo contrarie vnto him in all his deſires. Which was the cauſe, that the poore Shepheard lying groue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the ground, and bedeawing the greene graſſe with his drerie teares, began to moane thus heauily.</p>
               <p>O death, wilt thou be ſtill deaſe vnto my cries? and wilt thou neuer heare me, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo often and ſo much vpon thee? Haſt thou not had time enough, to rid me of my troubles, and wilt thou (ſtill) thus driue me off with delaies continually? Thinkeſt thou, he can liue, who pineth away piecemeale, whileſt he is fettered with worſe than Iton ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natles, in the ioy leſſe dungeon of vnmercifull Loue?</p>
               <p>No, he cannot, for he liueth not at all; but rather, miſerably conſumeth away, who ſeeth himſelfe, not onely depriued of his deſire, but alſo is quite debarred of all hope, euer to obtaine the ſame.</p>
               <p>Ah deare Loue, if euer thou (heretofore) haſt loued, empoyſoning thine owne ſoule, with thine owne proper venome, and if thy Mother likewiſe, hath often plaid the ſelfeſame part, why then doeſt not thou take pittie vpon thoſe, who haue endured the ſame Martyrdome? and ſince thou knoweſt their diſeaſe (by thine owne experience) why doeſt thou ſo long defer to bring them remedies for the ſame? Well, cruell <hi>Cupid,</hi> well, I ſee thou art blind indeed, nor haſt thou any regard at all to helpe me.</p>
               <p>The better thou art attended on, the worſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe, as one who by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is borne to doe hurt, but not good vnto any. Woe is me, I liue without hope of any helpe, more diſconſolate, than that <hi>Pilot,</hi> who though he ſaileth in a thicke and gloomie ſtorme, yet doth he hope (the ſame being paſt) to ſee the Sunne ſhine againe, truſting in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15406:144"/>the end ſafely to arriue within the wiſhed Hauen.</p>
               <p>But in my darke tempeſt, and in my ſtinging corſiues and bitter croſſes, I ſee no hope of any ſigne of comfort to ſhine, or ſmile vpon me. Eternall is my ſhipwracke, and my trauaile is without all end. O faire <hi>Diana,</hi> although thou art vnkind vnto me, yet doe I take no ſmall pride, to call my ſelfe thy ſlaue, for nothing can come neere thee in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither can I belieue, that the heauens the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues can create a beautie, able to parago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe thine. Happie is that Bull, that is choſen to be offered vp as an oblation or ſacrifice vnto the Gods, although his blood be there ſhed, and ſo moſt fortunate ſhould I account my ſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for thy ſake, I might be thought worthy to finiſh my daies, ſeeing that for thee, I ſhould ſuffer death, and be ſactificed by Loue, vpon the Altar of thine extreame rigor and fiercenes.</p>
               <p>Thus wailed the Shepheard, his eies ſending downe whole ſtreames of ſalt teares, which watered his face and cheekes all ouer; I ſeeing this, came neerer vnto him, and whileſt (he not perceiuing me) I began to marke, &amp; behold his countenance, which I ſaw quite colourleſſe, and the very Anatomie of an inward afflicted minde, whereby I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he had found no more fauour then I had, at his Miſtris hands, neither that his fortune was any way better then mine. This was the reaſon, my ſecond doubt died, but not my firſt, which ſtill increaſed more and more, becauſe I ſawe ſhe was ſued and ſought vnto by many, although I could not find any, to be more in her bookes then I was, which God knoweth was little or nothing at all.</p>
               <p>As I was thinking hereupon, a ſuddaine deſire came into my minde, to returne vnto the place from whence I came, and there attend my faireſt Saint, for me thought ſtill, ſhe ſhould be come thither alreadie, and that (ſhe not finding me there) was gone home againe, iudging my Loue, not to be ouerhot, ſeeing I had ſo ſmall patience to ſtay a little for her.</p>
               <p>Being come to mine old place, as faſt as I could, I began there to condemne mine owne follie, in that I would not take time whileſt I might, but rather ſo fooliſhly looſe ſo fitan occaſion, as I had offered vnto me; and this new accident ingendred another trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in me. Loue is an Orchard wherein are planted thouſands of Trees, in which Louers walke, gathering continually diuers ſorts of fruits, of griefe and ſorrow, and it is a liuely ſpring of miſerie, from whence doe flow, millions of little Riuers, of penſiue care, and ſad woe.</p>
               <p>Long had I not kept my ſtand, but that one of the Nymphs came by, who was one of the play-fellowes of my Ladie, of whom I enquired if <hi>Diana</hi> were comming from the Temple or no. Offentimes, the ouer great curiouſnes we haue to vnderſtand newes, bringeth vs much dollor, and ſadnes. As then, I found the ſame to be true, for the Nymph told me, that <hi>Diana</hi> would ſtay all that night in the Temple, and that <hi>Phoebus,</hi> being amorous of her, had intreated his Siſter <hi>Phoebe,</hi> that ſhe might remaine there vntill the next day, to the end he might enioy her company.</p>
               <p>This vnwelcome newes, vtterly ouerthrew me, I ſeeing my ſelfe to be bearded with ſuch a companion in my Loue, as no doubt would put my noſe out of ioynt, and chaſe away that ſmall hope, that I had before to creepe into ſome little credit with her.</p>
               <p>Although (ſome might thinke) that I had had great reaſon to haue reioyced, that I had ſo great a God (vnto my Riuall) in my Loue, yet neuertheleſſe, I bare ſo proud a nunde, as (like another <hi>Marſius</hi>) I could willingly haue hazarded my skinne againſt him, ſo I might haue hindered him from enioying my Ladie. But they that are bound muſt needs obey, the weakeſt muſt vnto the wall, and ſuch as are inferiours, muſt yeeld vnto the will of their ſuperiours and betters.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech of the foreſaid Virgin, made me almoſt beſides my ſelfe, for I iudged (and not without reaſon) that ſo faire a dame (after ſhe had enioyed the Amitie of ſo mightre a God) would neuer vouchſafe to ſtoo pe ſo low, as daigne to thinke vpon a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Shepheard; and this was the cauſe I counted my ſelfe as vtterly vndone, and with this heauie reſolution I withdrew my ſelfe vnto my poore cottage, where I gaue my ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to weepe and waile at my pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But whether it were, that the Nymph had falſe intelligence, or whether ſhe ment to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15406:145"/>be merrie with me or no, I know not, for my <hi>Diana</hi> ſtaied not that night in the Temple, but preſently after I was gone, returned vnto the ſelfeſame place, where I (ſo long) had expected her coming: which when I vnderſtood, I was more vexed &amp; grieued, then I had bene before, thinking my ſelfe to be forſaken of all good fortune: and thereupon as one mad for very anger, I tore my h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For that Louer cannot iuſtly ſay, he hath done any worthy thing in the behalfe of his ſweet Saint, who aimeth at his owne contentment alone, ſtudying out how to benefit himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But he may be ſaid to haue made a proofe of faithfull Amitie indeed, who hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, not for his owne good, but for his Ladies, whoſe reputation, good name and ſame, is more deare vnto him, then his owne proper life.</p>
               <p>This then was the cauſe, that I was not ſorrie, although my <hi>Diana</hi> had neuer ſo many worthy Poets at her command; onely, I was exceedingly afraid, leſt ſhe ſhould (therefore) make the leſſe account of me, when ſhe had others that could doe as well, &amp; as much as my ſelfe: and yet neuertheleſſe (I proteſt I ſpeake not this to flatter my ſelfe) ſhe ſhewed not ſo good a countenance vnto this freſh water Souldiour in the campe of <hi>Cupid,</hi> as ſhe did vnto me. For theſe were the ſpeeches ſhe vſed vnto him, after ſhe had red his Sonnets.</p>
               <p>Certainely, ſweet is that verſe, and daintie is the vaine of that Muſe, that taketh a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Subiect to exerciſe her diuine power with all, as braue and goodly, ſeemeth the ſwift courſer, which runneth in a faire and ſpatious plaine, being guided by a very expert and excellent Horſeman.</p>
               <p>But as it is not eaſie, to make him that is crooked, ſtraight, and as he that goeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtooping, can hardly walke bolt vpright: Euen ſo, although one haue neuer ſo rare a vaine to endite, yet if he haue no worthie matter, whereon to be employed, he can hardly write learnedly.</p>

               <p>I ſpeake this (Shepheard) vnto this end, I well perceiue thy Muſe is wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to paint me forth moſt brauely: but yet neuertheleſſe, I muſt needs tell thee, that when thou haſt done all thou canſt, it is to no purpoſe, becauſe thou ſhalt neuer be able to make the world beleeue otherwiſe, then that I am a poore ſillie ſoule, ſimple and plaine, and one that haue not, as much as one good qualitie in me.</p>

Leaue then I pray thee, to poetiſe thus vpon me, and rather beſtow it vpon ſome other, that doth better deſerue it, for too ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple am I, to be a Subiect for thy Muſe.</p>

               <p>To refuſe the gift of another, is as much as not to wiſh him well, or to ſeeke not to be beholding vnto him, for feare leſt we ſhould be conſtrained to make him ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends: for as the giuer, in beſtowing a preſent, doth ſhew his good will, ſo he that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the gift (in accepting thereof) doth make manifeſt his good minde vnto him: Euen ſo, my Miſtris in refuſing the fruits of the new Louers Muſe, gaue ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie ſhe did not much affect him, of which thing when I heard, I was not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And yet (God he knoweth) how much I was at that time gaulled with afflictions, ſeeing ſo many contrarie windes (and all in one day) to toſſe and tumble my weather beaten Barke. All that long night could I not ſleepe, as much as one winke, as often as I remembred the ineſtimable pleaſure which that great God enioyed (as I fooliſhly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) with my <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, I began to grow exceeding iealous, doubting leſt, ſhe being now come to haue ſo glorious a Deitie, vnto her Paramour, would diſdaine the Loue of any other mortall creature, yea, and that now ſhe onely doated vpon him.</p>
               <p>I dreamed of the great delight <hi>Apolle</hi> tooke, to haue in his armes ſo rare a Paragon, but I neuer (all this while) thought vpon that which moſt of all concerned me, which was the chaſte and pure vertues of my Ladie: for although I did beleeue verily, that (as that night) ſhe lay betweene the armes of that God, yet could I not chuſe but loue her, as much as I had done before; ſuch great force hath Loue ouer vs, as he maketh vs loue our Miſtriſſes (although they be bad and vitious) as well as if they were well giuen and vertuous; nay I was ſo farre wide from reaſon, as I thought ſhe was to be excuſed in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the requeſt of ſo mightie a God, not thinking this to be any blemiſh vnto her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at all.</p>
               <p>Thus euery Bird, ſuppoſeth her owne neaſt to be moſt faireſt, and euery mother her owne child, pretieſt, although it be miſhapen, and deformed.</p>
               <p>But when I was aſſured (of a certaine truth) that my Ladie had not onely, not laine that night in the Temple, but rather like another <hi>Daphne,</hi> or a new <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> had moſt vertuouſly refuſed this great God, reiected his promiſes, diſdained his gifts, ſhamed and hated his preſence; ah then, two contrarie doubts, began a freſh to combat in my heart, the one was, of contentment, ſeeing my <hi>Diana</hi> ſo wiſe, ſo modeſt, and ſo vertuous: the other was of diſpaire, imagining (and not without cauſe) that if ſhe had refuſed the amitie of ſo great a God, much leſſe would ſhe make any reckoning or account of me.</p>

For the rare conſtancie which ſhe had ſhewed, againſt the ſollicitings, and inticement of that God, made me to looke more craneſtly into the greatnes of the fault (which ſhe ſhould haue committed) then I had done before: like vnto him, that flinging himſelfe into a large Riuer, the more he wadeth in the water, the more he thinketh of the danger he is in, not dreaming of the ſame before.</p>
               <p>This made me to admire her more then euer I had done in times paſt, although I perceiued, I was out of all hope, to be affected of her.

               <p>Moſt ſacred is this diuine Goddeſſe, we chooſing rather to be afflicted for her ſake, then to caſt our liking vpon vgly and deformed vice.</p>

               <p>I curſe my tongue, and hate my ſelfe, for my ouer-raſh beliefe, I die with inward griefe, knowing and acknowledging no torments (were they neuer ſo terrible) to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to expiate this my hainous ſinne, which I had committed againſt her, whome I accounted of, more then of my life.</p>
               <p>Faine would I haue waſhed eleane this foule ſpotte, with my deareſt blood, but as then it was not poſſiblé, for I ſaw there was no other remedie, but I muſt attend the iuſt iudgement of my Ladie pronounced againſt me, who with a little Chollor, and yet ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therewithall, beganne thus to expoſtulate the matter with me.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon (Shepheard) that thou thus iudgeſt ill of mee? and what proofe haſt thou ſeene of mine incontinencie, to thinke that I would ſo quicklie ſuffer my ſelfe to be abuſed by <hi>Loue?</hi> what haue I done (euer) vnto thee, that thou ſhouldſt ſuſpect mine honor? and what outrage haſt thou receiued of mee, who neuer offended thee, to thinke me an enemie vnto mine owne credit.</p>
               <p>Ah Shepheard, let vs not iudge other men, vnleſſe we would be iudged againe: and let vs not ſeeke the defamation of an other, leſt wee our ſelues be tryed by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious order.</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou think, that I eſteem not more mine honor, then I do the Empire of the Gods, the one of which, being deſtroyed, may be repaired againe: but the other once loſt and gone, can neuer be recouered anie more.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible for miſerable wretches to chaunge their bad Fortunes, and of Beggars, to become mighty Kings and Monarks, as was <hi>Cyrus, Romulus, Denis</hi> of <hi>Siracuſa, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Tambarlaine,</hi> and diuers others: who from poore ſillie Shepheards, haue come through the fauour of Fortune, to be Soueraigne Princes. But that woman, that hath once loſt her honor, can neuer attaine vnto the ſame againe, by anie manner of meanes, what force or violence ſo euer ſhee pretendeth, or alleadgeth for her excuſe. This ſpotte beeing ſo blacke, as it (neuer) can be brought to be white anie more. For to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15406:148"/>make that thing which hath bene, not to haue bene at all, exceedeth the power of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men, onely God alone can doe it.</p>
               <p>Tell me then, doeſt thou ſuppoſe, that I will change mine honour, for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Gods? No, for <hi>Iupiter</hi> (although hee be the maiſter of the Gods) yet is not he quite exempted from blame: and great perſonages oftentimes, erre ſooner then meaner perſons, whereas the vertuous woman is alwayes commended, and entertained by the wiſer ſort. Yea, farre more then ſuch a one as is fooliſh, for all her byrth and greatnes.</p>
               <p>Little be thoſe Countries accounted of, where honour is not in requeſt, and ſuch Princes ſmallie deſerue to be magnified, who make no eſteeme of Vertue. Better is it for a man to be poore, and well giuen, then to be rich, and full of vices.</p>
               <p>What good did the Signorie of <hi>Cicill,</hi> vnto <hi>Denis</hi> the younger? but onely to make him the more miſerable: yea, farre more then the meaneſt of his owne ſubiects, and all becauſe hee was wicked. But vertue, quite contrarie to the other, ſtood <hi>Dion</hi> in great ſtead, who being but a ſillie fugitiue, and a forſaken banniſhed man (through her) got forces ſufficient to driue away the Tyrant, to ſet his Countrey at libertie, and to make him famous throughout the wide world.</p>
               <p>More highly priſd was <hi>Octania,</hi> the cliaſte wife of <hi>Marke Antony,</hi> beeing in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then the ſhameleſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for all her Realmes and riches: in as much as the one was modeſt and vertuous, whereas the other, was common and infamous.</p>
               <p>What renowme or credit followeth (now at this day) the infamous memorie of <hi>Semiramis, Meſſalina,</hi> of <hi>Faustina,</hi> and diuers ſuch other Empreſſes? only this, that they are regiſtred for their immodeſt liues, in the blacke booke of reproachfull ſhame, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. My life ſhall firſt ende, before I will beginne to liue in this bad order, ſo farre from all good order.</p>
               <p>No, no, neuer will I ſtrike my Shippe againſt ſuch a Rocke, neither will I ſuffer ſhipwracke, in ſo ignominious a Sea, what Dietie ſoeuer ſhall intreat mee therevnto: For pouertie ioyned with Vertue, may be counted great riches, where Nobleneſſe and wealth, being lincked with vice, cannot anie way be ſaid to be other, then extreame and wretched miſerie.</p>
               <p>Well (Shepheard well) thou haſt accuſed me, before I haue done a fault, and thou haſt laide a vice vnto my charge, of which my foule is innocent. Then, what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were due (of right) vnto thee, if I ſhould meaſure this thy groſſe errour, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the rigour of vnpartiall Iuſtice? and if (as <hi>Arachne</hi>) was plagued, I ſhould make thee beare the heauie burthen of thine owne offence?</p>
               <p>Long time agone, (amongſt the Auncients) this was a Lawe, that hee (who cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, had accuſed the guiltleſſe) ſhould haue ſuffered the ſelfe-ſame puniſhment, which the perſon accuſed, ſhould haue endured, if hee had bene culpable of the ſame offence, whereof he accuſed the other.</p>
               <p>Thinkeſt thou, I value not my credit at as high a rate as <hi>Daphne, Caſſandra,</hi> and ſuch others, who could neuer be brought to veelde vnto the vnhoneſt appetites of the Gods? Too pretious and rate, is this ineſtimable Iewell, to make ſo light account thereof: rather belieue thou, that I will ſooner loofe my life, then let goe mine honour vnto anie.</p>
               <p>Chaunge then thy ſpeech, and ſeeke not (hereafter) anie more to defame ſo rich a Treaſor, as the honour of a woman is, vnleſſe thou haue better proofes then thou haſt had of mine: for more hurtfull and pernitious is a ſlaunderer and a falſe accuſer, then a moſt mortall and deadly enemie, becauſe the firſt ſeeketh to take away that, which the Gods themſelues are not able to render backe againe: whereas the other, bereaueth vs, but of life onely, which is ſubiect vnto death continually.</p>
               <p>Wretched are thoſe perſons that doe ill, and yet reape no commoditie thereby, for what good commeth vnto the backbiter by ſpeaking ill of anie, but onely that in the ende, hee himſelfe is hated of euery bodie? Play not thou this part, neither ſtumble thou into this foule ditch, eſpecially, doe not blame her, whome thou makeſt a ſhewe to loue ſo much.</p>
               <p>But thy ſpeeches diſcouer (ſufficiently enough) what thy affection is, for if thou
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15406:148"/>hadſt ſuppoſed mee to be ſuch a one, I cannot beleue that euer thou couldeſt haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee, becauſe commonly wee ought to hate vice, and reſpect and preferre vertue. For ſuch as make the world beleeue that they beare affection vnto fooliſh women, doe not loue them indeed, but onely ſeeke to enioy part of thoſe pleaſures, as they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate vnto others. So as it is impoſſible, that a vertuous and a conſtant Loue, can haue any other foundation, then Vertue it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is but meere follie for thee, to make me belieue (hereafter) through thy fained teares, and diſſembling ſpeeches, that thou loueſt mee: For is it likely, that one can loue an other, whom hee himſelfe blameth, and whom hee thinketh worthie of reprehenſion and ſhame?</p>
               <p>If thou haſt loued mee for my Vertue, which thou imagineſt I haue now loſt: for what wilt thou loue me hereafter? The cauſe being taken away, the effect dieth, and the foundation of a Building, being ruinated, the houſe whereon it ſtandeth, muſt needs fall, becauſe nothing can be without his cauſe or ſubiect. If the cauſe ceaſeth in mee, which was the motiue of thy Loue: then needes thy former affection muſt ceaſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore (I pray thee) make me belieue no more, that thou beareſt any good liking vnto me; for I neuer can, nor will giue credit vnto thee, nor will belieue therein. Or if thou did deſt loue me, then I muſt needs thinke, thou didſt it to betray me, and ſo to corrupt mine honor. I ſay therefore, that ſo farre off, is thy loue from being Amitie, as (rather quite contrarie) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> eſteeme it to be deadly hatred, and moſt furious rage. So as theſe bad conditions being in thee, I can haue no occaſion to loue thee, but rather haue more reaſon to loath and deteſt thee, as the moſt mortall aduerſary that I haue, vnto that thing, which is far dearer vnto me, then is my deareſt life, that is, my pretious honour.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid the Chollorike <hi>Diana,</hi> and to confeſſe but truth, ſhe had good reaſon ſo to ſay. For there is no guileleſſe ſoule, that (without being ſomewhat moued) can heare herſelfe ill ſpoken off, neither can the moſt vertuous perſon that is, endure to be falſlie ſlaundered, but that he muſt needs growe a little in Choller.</p>
               <p>As that child, who being already forth of the Schoole doore (thinking he is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the fields, and that hee is playing amongſt his companions abroad) looketh very ſadly, and is wonderfully amazed, when vpon the ſuddaine, his Tutor taketh him by the chollar of his doublet, and bringeth him againe, correcting him with the rodde, for his ouerbold and fooliſh hardines. Euen ſo found I my ſelfe to be confounded, with ſilent heauines, and being wonderfully afflicted, with inward anguiſh and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Great is that Corſie and ſharpe which a man feeleth, when through ouermuch headdie raſhnes, he offen deth that thing which hee eſteemeth moſt of all in this world. Euen ſo, vnſupportable is that griefe, when a man falſly accuſeth his friend, whoſe credit he would ſeeke to preferre, before his owne deareſt hart blood.</p>
               <p>Ah, why (then) did not the earth open, to ſwallow mee vp? and why (at that time) did not the Sunne obſcure it ſelfe, as when he was three daies without appearing abroad, diſdaining to behold ſo horrible a crueltie of an vnnaturall father, committed by him, againſt his owne young and prettie children.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpeeches of mine innocent Lady (iuſtly incenſed againſt mee) was as a poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned darte, piercing quite through my poore ſoule.

               <p>As then, no other anſwere could I giue vnto my Miſtris, then ſalt teares, trickling downe along my cheekes, whilſt from my breaſt (as from a Furnace) iſſued forth great ſtore of ſcalding ſighes. O how happie had I beene at that time, if ſome one courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God or other, would haue transformed me into ſome rocke, ſome ſtone, or elſe, into ſome Tree.

               <p>It is an old ſaide Sawe; One miſchiefe neuer commeth alone, but that it hath an other attending vppon it. And ſo (by misfortune) it happened vnto mee.

This did I thinke to be a fit way, for me to diſpatch and drowne my ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the more it did rage, the more I thought it ſufficient to take my life from me. And now was I readie to leap downe into the ſame, I hauing cloſed mine eres, ſtretcht out my armes, and bowed my head, to make this dangerous leap, when I hard a voice that called me, it being a voice, that ſounded like vnto that of my <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I opened mine eies, I lifted vp my head, and looked backeward, to ſee if I could perceiue the partie that named my name; but I could find nothing but Trees, Stones, and Buſhes.</p>
               <p>Wherupon I returned againe vnto my firſt courſe, offering my ſelfe moſt willingly vnto death, minding no more to defer, nor delay to put in practiſe my cruell exployt any longer, when the ſame voice (which I hard but a little before) put me off from my determination, I being very deſirous to know who it was, that thus (twiſe) had called me.</p>
               <p>This made me to ſearch (once more) vp and downe, although I could finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (O foole ſaid I vnto my ſelfe) am I ſo mad, to thinke that ſhe, whom I haue ſo hainouſly abuſed, will vouchſafe to doe me good, and helpe me? Nay rather, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath ſhee to deſire any thing (ſo much) as my deſtruction and ouerthrow, to the intent ſhee may be reuenged of ſo vile an outrage, as ſhee hath receiued at my hands.</p>
               <p>No no, it is meere follie to looke for any ſuccour from her, when nought but death can rid me of mine anguiſh.</p>
               <p>This voice, which I heare is (no doubt) of ſome wicked Spirit, which would haue me turne backe into the world, to liue in continuall wretchednes, as I haue heretofore done. But I meane not to be ſo deluded, for die I will, and ſo rid my ſelfe from all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as are like (henceforward) to light vpon me; and with this minde, I went (once more) vp to the top of that Rocke, from whence (without all doubt, I had flung my ſelfe) but that I eſpied (a far of) a ſhip toſſed and tumbled with a great Tempeſt, which withheld me (as then) from the ſame, for I tooke (mee thought) a kind of compaſſionate pleaſure, to ſee how the winds, maiſtered the leaking veſſell, cauſing it one while to reele one on ſide, and then vpon the other, tarning vp and downe, as a Barrell that is emptie; for the winds dryuing it with a contrarie blaſt, caſt great Billowes of water into the ſame, touching the tops of Rocks, and making the ſhore ſide white and fomie, with a thicke froth, ſtriking a great terror in the mindes of the Sailers.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, a mightie waue came flowing ouer the ſhip, as if it would haue ſuncke it, which made the Sailers to beſtirre themſelues, plying the pumpe vntill they did ſweat.</p>
               <p>And now the Sunne began to be darkened, the Cloudes to looke gloomie and blacke, and the ſtorme to encreaſe more and more, whileſt raigne and lightning fell from heauen, as faſt as water falleth from the Mountaines. The Paſſengers within, lay all as if they had bene dead, whileſt moſt pittious outcries, wofull complaints, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exclaimings were heard amongſt them, euery bodie calleth for ſuccor, but none doth helpe, the noyſe of the waters, and the roaring of the windes, hindering the Sailers ſo much, as they could not vnderſtand one another.</p>
               <p>The Pilot, that held the ſterne, and guided the ſhip, with a pale and dead colour, one while cried out, another while made ſignes with his hands, to make them vnderſtand
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15406:150"/>what they ſhould doe, but what with the pittious wailing within, and what with the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noyſe abroad, they could not know what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>And (now) the ſterne grew ſo violent, as euery one was appalled therewithall, they being driuen into ſuch a feare, as they could neither heare, nor gather what the maiſter of the ſhip commanded, ſo as giuing ouer to looke vnto their ſhip, they (all) began to make a moſt dolefull outcrie, wringing their hands, and tearing the haire from off their heads, as if they had bene mad.</p>
               <p>Which the Pilot perceiuing, he likewiſe gaue ouer his charge, for to no purpoſe was it for him to hold the Sterne any longer, whileſt ſome of them (not many of them all well knowing what they did) ran to the Rudder, ſome to the Maſt, ſome ſet vp Sailes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome pulled them downe, ſome ran vp to the Tackling, other tumbled downe from thence, one ran to doe one thing, and another went to doe another: and to be briefe, they (all) laboured ſo confuſedly, as they rather did hurt then good any way. To conclude, churliſh <hi>Boreus,</hi> blew more extreamly then he had done before, whileſt <hi>Eolus,</hi> gaue leaue vnto the bluſtring windes, to play their parts.</p>
               <p>The Sea encreaſed in raging, and the Monſters thereof appeared aboue the water, the more to affright ſuch as beheld them.</p>
               <p>The Sterne of the ſhip burſteth and falleth in peeces. The Sailes are all broken and rent, the Decke or forepart of the veſſell, turneth vp and downe, the ſides of the ſame are left bare, whileſt the ſhip (being as quite without defence) &amp; able any longer to reſiſt the violence of the outragious flotings of the Sea, yeeldeth vnto the mercie thereof, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whirling Billowes to winde themſelues within her; which the Paſſengers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, crie out aloud for mercie vnto the heauens, expecting euery minute of an houre, to be ſwallowed downe into the bottome of the Surges.</p>
               <p>At laſt the ſhip runneth againſt that Rocke, vpon the top of which I ſtood, hauing all this long while, beheld this wofull ſpectacle, with the teares ſtreaming downe mine cies.</p>
               <p>The maiſter and the reſt of the Sailers, doe what they can (poore ſoules) to hinder her from ſplitting aſunder, but all in vaine, the furie of the ſtorme is ſo cruell and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, whereupon euery man ſeeketh to ſaue himſelfe, a great number of them being gotten into the little Skiffe that was tied vnto the ſhip; but the ſame being ouer-charged with multitude, becauſe euery one ſought to get therein, ſunke preſently, drowning all thoſe that were within her.</p>
               <p>Onely one young man eſcaped, ſauing himſelfe, through the ſtrength of his armes and legs; he ſwimming ſo luſtily, as at laſt he got vnto the foote of the Rocke, againſt which, the veſſell ran, and ſo brake all in peeces. This youth being (all ouer) durtie and foule, looked pale for very feare, and (yet) ſeemed he to reioyce, in that he hath ſcaped the furie of <hi>Neptune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great was the pleaſure he tooke, to ſee himſelfe deliuered from death, and yet by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little he began to growe heauie againe (ſeeing himſelfe in ſuch a place) as was vnhabited and like a wilderneſſe, ſhroadly doubting, leaſt hunger would make an end of that which the Sea had not, and that he hardly could get pardon of the earth to liue, as he had (before) of <hi>Neptune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A new griefe, and a nouell terror of death aſſaileth him afreſh, whileſt being (thus) alone, he ſigheth to thinke of his hard fortune. He caſteth his eies here and there, and looketh round about, to ſee if any would come to helpe him. But he could not perceiue no ſuch ſight, and he liſteneth with his care, to hearken if he could heare the ſound of any voice, but all was in vaine, it would not be, he knoweth not whether the firme land will be more kind vnto him, then the vnſtable Seas, and doubteth much the ſame. He is in dread, that he ſhall die, either through drinking too much, or for eating too little, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doth he thanke the heauens, to haue ſaued him from ſhipwracke in the Sea, ſeeing he is likely to die through famine, on the land. Now whileſt he thus ſigheth and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, I (hearing his ſpeech) ſtraitwaies knew him by his tongue, to be the miſcrable <hi>Fortumo</hi> ſometimes companion in my for mer Loues.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, I holding vp my hands vnto the skies, thanked them, that it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, to graunt me ſo much fauour, as I might be able to be a meanes to ſaue the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15406:151"/>lire of mine old friend, honouring my lateſt end, with ſo charitable and compaſſionate a piece of worke.</p>
               <p>I bleſſed the voice, that before had hindered me from dying, being ſorie that I had blamed it ſo much as I had done, ſeeing I might preſerue one of my beſt acquaintance from death; not that I had altered my firſt determination, as if I had bene vnwilling to periſh, but that I had not done (ſo) before I had brought to paſſe ſo good a deed.</p>
               <p>Thereupon I came running downe from where I was, as faſt as I could, when the poore ſoule, who hard me comming a farre off, and yet had not ſeene me at all, thinking I had bene ſome wilde beaſt, that came to deuour him (chuſing as the Blackebird vſeth, rather to commit himſelfe vnto the mercie of a man, then to endure the griping nailes of the Sparrow-hawke, that followeth him in flight) leapeth againe into the wide Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſtriuing with all the force he could, and with the vtmoſt of his cunning he had in ſwimming, to get as farre as he might from the ſhore ſide, which but a little before, he with much adoe had attained vnto. I being come downe, and ſeeing him in the maine Sea, called him oftentimes by his name, but the ſurges thereof, made ſuch a noyſe, as he heard me not, carrying him ſtill farther off from me, which when I perceiued, I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew my plaints, grieuing as well at his misfortune, as mine owne, and the rather, becauſe where I thought to haue ſaued him, I was his vtter ruine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he, in the meane ſpace, tooke great paines in ſwimming, blowing &amp; puffing through extreame wearines; and ſtriuing vnto the vtmoſt of his ſtrength to get vnto ſome other landing place.</p>
               <p>But Fortune, who in deſpite of himſelfe, would needes ſaue him, or perhaps would ſhewe me ſo much fauour, in lieu of ſo much, and ſuch hard dealing as ſhe had vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, cauſed the Sea, who went about to drowne him, to be the onely meanes to ſaue him. Strange is the beliefe of men, for God (oftentimes) (that they may perceiue moſt plainely how he diſpoſeth of euery thing) maketh them to finde ſuccour, from ſuch as they account their chiefe enemies, expecting no fauour nor curteſie at all from them: and ſo it fell out with <hi>Fortunio,</hi> for behold (vpon the ſuddaine, a Billowe of the Sea, droue him (although againſt his will) backe vnto the foote of the Rocke, from which he was of late parted, he being ſo ouertyred with labour, as he was in a manner without winde or force, whereupon I came vnto him, comforted him, reuiuing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and putting life afreſh into him.</p>
               <p>That great vnbeleeuing Prophet, was not more ioyfull when that huge Whale had caſt him forth ſafe, and aliue, vpon the Sea coaſt (after he had lodged three daies and nights in the bellie of the ſame) as <hi>Fortunio</hi> was, when he then ſawe me, and knewe me for <hi>Arcas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This made him to take heart a grace, and to plucke vp his former Spirits, and yet when he looked wiſtly vpon me, and ſawe me looke with ſo pale and heauie a cheare, he could not chuſe but be maruellous ſorie to behold me, in that pittious plight, whileſt he vrged me often, and that with great earneſtnes, to bewray vnto him the occaſion of my ſorrowes, which I concealed from him. In the end, when he ſawe there was no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and that I was loth to bewray my minde vnto him, he gaue ouer to inquiſitiue therein any more, not a little comforting himſelfe, in that he had ſo happily lighted vpon me, who was the cauſe, he had bene reſerued from a dangerous kinde of death.</p>
               <p>But I perceiuing he had need of warme cloaths, and other comfortable neceſſaries, fit to nouriſh him, and to reſtore him vnto his former health, tooke him with me to walke homewards, towards my little cottage, demaunding of him (as we went) of all his Fortunes, ſince I laſt had ſeene him; which as he was about to ſatisfie me, behold, whom ſhould I meete withall, but my ſacred <hi>Diana,</hi> who with the other Nymphs (her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions) was walking abroad, to take the open aire.</p>
               <p>As that Shehpeard is frighted with a ſudden feare, when he ſeeth to fall before his eies great flaſhes of lightning, which burneth, ſpoyleth, and blaſteth ſome goodly huge Oke, that ſerued as a ſhadow for his wearie flocks, to reſt themſelues therein: Euen ſo was I aſtoniſht, trembling through euery ioynt, when I called vnto remembrance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15406:151"/>my former fault, and how hainous the crime was which I had done againſt her. Faine would I as then haue taken occaſion by the haire of the head, that I might haue excuſed my ſelfe vnto her, and ſo haue pleaded for her gratious pardon: but alas, my ſpeech fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me, and I was quite without heart or courage.</p>
               <p>The beautious Virgin, perceiuing in what a pittifull plight I was in (as one very wiſe) quickly geſſed, the truth of the reſpect I bare vnto her, was the reaſon why I was ſo confounded, and void of all my ſences. Which was the cauſe ſhe now began to thinke the better of me, repenting (as it were) that ſhe had taken me vp ſo roundly before, and therefore ſhe thought it not amiſſe to put courage into me againe, by vſing ſome grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches vnto me, before ſhe would leaue me. Whereupon ſhe ſmiling, began thus to queſtion with me. What is the matter She; heard, that now thou art thus tongue-tied, who before haddeſt thy voice at commaund, and couldeſt diſcourſe ſo readily and well?</p>
               <p>Speake man, and feare not to anſwere: for more good doth he that ſpeaketh, then another that holdeth his peace &amp; ſaith nothing. Courage, and feare not any thing at all. It is not my nature to be angrie long, I knowing it to be a more commendable qualitie, to be curteous, then to be ſorie and cruell.</p>
               <p>If thy tongue hath bene the cauſe, that mine hath ſpoken ſome ſharpe ſpeech or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which perhaps may ſomewhat grieue thee, then blame thy ſelfe for the ſame, and not me, for that woman argueth her ſelfe to be culpable, that ſeeketh not to defend her honour, which ſhe vnderſtandeth, is readie to be defamed.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon I ment not to take farther puniſhment of thee, I being well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, with the firſt checke I gaue in words vnto thee. Why then, art thou thus moued? doeſt thou thinke thou ſhalt commit an abſurdutie, and ſhalt not be told of the ſame? If ſo, thou then ſhouldeſt be in better taking then the Gods themſelues, who are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from rebukes.</p>
               <p>Hereafter learne to be more wiſe, and conſider well of the circumſtance of the deed done, before thou iudgeſt thereof, for of the cenſure that is giuen in the worſer part, againſt the good name &amp; fame of women, euery one maketh a benefit (although it be falſe and ſcandalous) and the reaſon is, for that men are more readier to diſpraiſe, then to commend, whether it be that they doe it of meere malice and diſpight, or becauſe they are deſirous to haue many like vnto themſelues, in their leaud and deteſtable kind of liuing.</p>
               <p>But what is good and well done, that quickly is forgotten, not any, as much as once reporting the ſame, becauſe ſuch as be ill giuen, will neuer commend any, except it be much againſt their minde. Feare not then to ſpeake, ſo thou ſpeake well, for ſo ſhalt thou pleaſe the beſt kind of people, and diſpleaſe none, but ſuch as are the worſt; for the fruit of a good tree, is more commended, then that which is bad.</p>
               <p>Speake then man, and ſay one thing or another, otherwiſe I ſhall imagine, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſdaine doth ſhut vp thy voice, or elſe that hatred hindereth thee from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>As that Souldiour is not a little ioyfull, when being readie to haue his head ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by the enemie, whoſe priſoner he is, he ſeeth his friends arriued and come to his aide, whereby he is rid from all danger: Euen ſo, not a little pleaſant was I, when I hard ſo ſweete a heauenly ſound, proceeding from ſo faire an Angell; which was of ſuch power, as it reuiued all my dying ſences in me, it baniſhed away all feare from me, it put new hope into me, and brought my former freſh colour into my cheekes againe. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I did proſtrate my ſelfe in moſt humble wiſe, before the feete of my Ladie (for well did ſhe deſerue a greater reuerence at my hands) but ſhe not willing I ſhould doe ſo, tooke me vp by the hand, by that bleſſed hand, I ſay, which chaſed all diſpaire from me. Whereupon I thus returned condigne thankes vnto him.</p>
               <p>Can you (moſt beautious Saint) raiſe, and reuiue him, who hath deſerued ſo much vengeance at your hands? and can you haue pittie vpon his bodie, who would not take no compaſſion vpon your honour?</p>
               <p>No Ladie, no, rather let him die, as one vnworthie to receiue from you, the leaſt fauour in the world: why ſhould you vouchſafe to looke vpon him, with thoſe heauenly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:15406:152"/>eyes of yours, not worthie of ſo great a grace: keepe thoſe ſweet and chaſte glaunces for him, who ſhall deſerue them better then my ſelfe, who merrit not, to ſee ſo much as the vſuall light of the heauen. Am I he (beautious Nymph) that haue ſo much abuſed thee, if ſo, why then ſhouldeſt thou vouchſafe me, to approach thy wonderous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</p>
               <p>Although thou of thy kind nature, ſhalt forget this foule fault of mine, yet ſhall mine owne plaine nurture, and bringing vp, teach me not to forgiue the ſame: for mine owne hand ſhall puniſh both my tongue and heart, the one for ſpeaking ill of thee, and the other for conceiuing a ſiniſter opinion againſt thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arcas,</hi> ſhall neuer ſurfer <hi>Arcas</hi> to goe ſcotfree, he hauing ſo hainouſly ſinned againſt his ſacred Saint.</p>
               <p>Trouble me not then, in mine owne buſines, but let me execute what I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die determined to doe; onely I would entreate this Boone, that it would pleaſe you to pardon my raſh crime before I die, for neuer did I willingly offend thee, onely, I was too too credulous, and ouer-light of beliefe.</p>
               <p>Too much credit did I giue, vnto that which one of thy companions reported vnto me, I thinking ſimplie, thou mighteſt full well count thy ſelfe happie, to be beloued of ſo great a God, but too ſacred is thy vertue, &amp; too modeſt thine honour, to be ouercome with any power of the Gods.</p>
               <p>Pardon then this fooliſh conceit of mine, which I will waſh cleare with the deareſt blood I haue, I thinking my ſelfe not a little happie in that I haue had the fortune to ſee thee before my death, and to haue acknowledged before thee, my more then groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and vaine follie. With great contentment ſhall I die, ſeeing I haue had the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to haue bewraied the ſecrets of my ſoule, &amp; ſhewed how far I was fro doing thee any willing iniurie. Beſides, I beſeech thee (by thy vnſpotted chaſtitie) to thinke, that no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Loue heretofore, is to be compared vnto that which wretched <hi>Arcas</hi> hath borne thee. Neuer could any faithfull affection equall his, no more then any beautious feature liuing, may be compared vnto thine.</p>
               <p>Then pardon (once more) I beg of thee, thy moſt wretched ſlaue, that he dying, may not die in the diſgrace of his Miſtris.</p>
               <p>I cannot denie, but that I haue erred, but yet not ſo much, of my ſelfe, as by reaſon of another, nothing ſo much grieuing me, as that I had ſo ſiniſter an opinion of thy match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vertue, and therefore, for this fault onely, will I adiudge my ſelfe to die. Happie is he that dieth in thy ſeruice, and for thy ſake: yea more happie then <hi>Piramus,</hi> that ſlew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his deare <hi>Thisbes;</hi> for he cannot finde fault with his death, that looſeth his life, for a rare and worthy Subiect.</p>
               <p>The guiltie perſon, being drawne vnto the place of execution, is pardoned of the partie, who cauſeth him to die, contenting himſelfe with his death, as a ſufficient ſat is fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the fault he hath committed.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo let me intreate thee, to diſcharge me a <hi>Culpa,</hi> though not a <hi>Pena,</hi> to the end, my death may expiate the horriblenes of the offence, and that I may with ioy, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, amongſt thoſe bleſſed ſhadowes. Graunt me then, this my laſt requeſt, otherewiſe, more wretched ſhall be my death, then that of good old <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who ſawe his owne children maſſacred before his owne face.</p>
               <p>More would I haue ſaid, but that curteous <hi>Diana</hi> interrupted me in my ſpeech, who being more mercifull, then Iuſtice it ſelfe, thus replied.</p>
               <p>No, Shepheard no, I neuer will yeeld vnto thy requeſt, becauſe I will not haue thee die. The Gods, although they be mightie and immortall, yet doe they not demaund of ſuch men (as haue offended them) to haue their liues in ſatisfaction of their fault, but are contented with ſome leſſer puniſhment: and doeſt thou thinke, that I am more cruell then they? If ſo, thou doeſt me wrong.</p>
               <p>Liue then I ſay, and talke no more of death, I pardon thee of thy fault, perſwading my ſelfe, that it was thy ouer raſh beliefe, and not thy minde, which did commit ſo groſe an ouerſight.</p>
               <p>Be merrie then, and aſſure thy ſelfe, that <hi>Diana</hi> was neuer cruell, but rather, that ſhe is as courteous, as ſhe hath, and will be chaſte.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:15406:152"/>
               <p>Take heede onely, that thou hereafter doe not ſo offend againe, and let the danger from which thou haſt (now eſcaped) make thee more wiſe againſt an other time. For ſometimes an offence ſtandeth in ſome good ſteed, when through remembrance of the ſame, it maketh others to be more warie and better aduiſed.</p>
               <p>As that Shepheard is ioyfull, who hath chaſed away the Wolfe, bringing backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his ſheepe ſafe and aliue, which the deuouring beaſt was carrying away; Euen ſo, was I pleaſed and ſatisfied at full, with this her kinde counſaile. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the going away of my faire <hi>Diana,</hi> did ſomewhat abate the ſweetneſſe thereof: for ſhee preſently left mee, eyther becauſe ſhee would not haue the other Nymphes knowe that ſhe had pardoned mee (who were hard at hand) or becauſe ſhee would not (as then) heare my anſwere, as if ſhe looked for thankes from mee. But howſoeuer it was, away ſhe went, and left me.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee, that the badde followeth vpon the necke of the good: and that no good chaunce can long continue in his firſt pride and force.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, I beganne to cheare my ſelfe, and to comfort <hi>Fortunio,</hi> whom I had ſaued from drowning, and who being (all the while) not farre off from mee, proteſting he neuer ſaw ſo exquiſite a beautie: No, although his <hi>Cleomine</hi> had bene preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not a little rauiſhed therewithall.</p>
               <p>Thus talking and deuiſing from one matter vnto an other, at length we got home, where, after hee had bene ſhifted, and laide into his warme bedde, and that hee had (for a while) refreſhed his wearie limmes, I deſired him to report all his Fortunes vnto mee, in which he willingly yeelded vnto mee, deliuering vnto mee this pitious hiſtorie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which I will now make thee partaker of. And hauing ſo ſaid, he pawſed a while, to take his breath the better, beginning thus.</p>
               <p>Know then (my good <hi>Arcas</hi>) after cruell diſcord, meger enuie, and inexorable deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had forced vs to leaue our ſweet abiding in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> we flying (as <hi>Melibeus</hi> did, from our owne Countrey) which was ſeazed vpon and enioyed, by a companie of cruell and barbarous men at Armes: I went and offered my ſeruice vnto a braue <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight, borne in the Kingdome of <hi>Arragon;</hi> hee being not inferiour (vnto anie of his time) for valour, or for Martiall ſtratagems belonging to the warres. Such Heroicall ſpirits as theirs, <hi>Fortune</hi> moſt commonly vſeth to tryumph ouer (as it were) to meddle with baſe and ignominious people: becauſe ſmall conqueſt is gotten by conquering ſuch a one, as hath neither force, nor power, to reſiſt, and therefore yeeldeth preſentlie.</p>
               <p>This Caualier was called <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> being in yeares ſome fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wealthie enough, and maruellous faire, and comely of perſonage. By manie braue deedes at Armes, hee had gotten to be, in the number of the beſt Souldiers of his time, and no doubt, hee hud growne to haue bene as famous, as that auncient <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> was heretofore: If cruell <hi>LOVE</hi> had not oppoſed himſelfe, againſt his notable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
               <p>There is no man that liueth, but hath his euill Angell attending vpon him, which darkeneth the faire weather of his good Fortunes, when he is likelieſt to riſe vnto great glorie and renowme.</p>
               <p>Needes muſt he taſte of ſome miſerie, for feare if hee ſhould be glutted too much with pleaſures, and neuer feele of aduerſitie, hee would quickly forget his Creator, and ſo diſdaine to be obedient vnto him. Not vnlike vnto that leaud ſeruant, who after he hath gotten enough in the ſeruice of his Maiſter, maketh no account of him, but leaueth him, and followeth his owne delights and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>I then being retained, and following this young Knight, followed his humour ſo well, as he made more account of mee, then he did of anie of his other ſeruants, and the rather, becauſe I would manie times report vnto him, ſome Accident or other, of our firſt loues and merriments of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> in which hee delighted wonderfullie.</p>
               <p>But had the poore Gentleman knowne (at that houre) what great hurt and damage hee was like to receiue by the ſelfe-ſame Loue, hee would haue ſtopped his eares againſt the diſcourſe of his might, neither would hee (euer) haue opened the gate of his kinde heart vnto ſo bloudie and periurde a Thiefe.</p>
               <p>But what? men that are luſtie and healthfull is bodie, many times feede vpon ſuch
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15406:153"/>kinde of meates, as they thinke (becauſe they pleaſe their tuſte) to be good, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they ſurfet vpon the ſame, and often die thereof.</p>
               <p>But my maiſter, as he was a braue Soldiour, ſo was hee a gallant Courtier, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Court much, as many of our beſt Captaines vſe.</p>
               <p>Now the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> had (as then) no more Children, then one goodly young Ladie, of the age of fifteene or ſixteene yeares, called <hi>Maria,</hi> beautifull in fauour, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in her behauiour, (but aboue all) paſſing vertuouſlie well giuen.</p>
               <p>Not long time after, it pleaſed God to ſend the Queene a young Sonne, by his wife, which was the cauſe that great ioy was made, throughout all the Court and Countrey, and great Feaſts and Tryumphs appointed for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The King himſelfe, cauſing ſolemne Iuſtes and Tiltings to be proclaimed. The Prize being a meruailous rich and ſtrong tempered Armour of proofe, with a daintie Courſer of <hi>Naples,</hi> for the Victor, which ſhould be deliuered him by the hands of his faire Daughter <hi>Maria:</hi> he knowing well, that a couragious Knight, would receiue ſuch a reward, with a farre better minde, from ſuch a goodly Princeſſe, then from anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>And now the time being appointed, and the day come, the Liſtes were open, and the running at Tilt begun: where many worthy Knights were aſſembled, to giue liuely proofs of their wonderfull valour they not ſo much coueting the prizes, for the richnes thereof, as they did for to haue the honour of the victorie, before ſo Royall an aſſemblie.</p>
               <p>The King being placed, with all his Nobles round about him, the young Princeſſe his Daughter, ſitting in a Throne of Maieſtie higher then the reſt, and euery thing being in ordes, fit for ſuch a meeting; Behold, the Trumpets ſounded, when the Challengers and the Defendants entred into the Liſtes, brauely mounted, and richly apparelled, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one wearing the Fauour of his Miſtris.</p>
               <p>Now after manie ſtaues were broken, and diuers Runners ouerthrowne, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> commeth into the fielde, hauing a plaine white Armour vpon him: his Coate Armour being painted with the flames of <hi>Cupids</hi> fire, and in his Shield, a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> drawne in moſt liuely colours. His manlie countenance, his comely ſtature, his gallant Port, and his ſtately preſence, drewe euerie mans eyes to behold him, marking him from the top of his head, vnto the ſole of his foote: ſo as none could iuſtly finde anie fault in him, ſo excellently was hee proportioned in all parts.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Like to <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſeem'd hee ſtrong and braue,</l>
                  <l>When hee, into their Towne, the <hi>Troyans</hi> draue.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Great hope and expectation was there, of the worthines of this Champion, who (as then) came luckilie into the Liſts. For all the <hi>Arragoneſes,</hi> (who were the Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) were ouerthrowne by the other ſtrangers, Knights.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner was hee entred in amongſt them, but that (ſuddenlie) all of his ſide, beganne to take courage againe, hoping (by his valour) hee would make amends, for the foyle which they had taken.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>As <hi>Hector</hi> did, who beat the <hi>Orecians</hi> Back,</l>
                  <l>That had (before) the <hi>Troyans</hi> put to wrack.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> placing his Speare in his wreſt, one ountred his Foes with ſuch force, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he made them to giue back vpon their ſaddles, or elſe turned them out from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vpon the bare ground. And ſo long did hee follow them in this chaſe, that in the ende the <hi>Arragonians</hi> got the maiſtrie, and he was adiudged to be victorious ouer all thoſe that ranne at Tilt, which was the cauſe that he was highly commended of the King himſelfe, and of all his Nobilitie, and of the Courtly Ladies, as his vertue well deſerued: recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Prize, from the daintie hands of that ſaite Princeiſe, who (wondering at his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie) preſenting the ſame vnto him, vſed theſe gratious ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Although this ſmall reward is worthie of acceptance, in that it hath bene wonne and brought away from ſo many gallant Gentlemen, to ſtand in ſtead of a recompence
<pb facs="tcp:15406:153"/>due vnto Vertue: yet is it nothing worth in reſpect of that, which your valour hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie wonne vnto you, which hath made you to be glorious, renowned, and famous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the worthieſt perſonages of the world. This which I here preſent you withall, is but a trifle, and of no weight, and yet of great importance: in that you haue ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſte it, by the vndoubted proofe of your dauntleſſe courage, which maketh it worthy of commendation, and not otherwiſe. Receiue it then (braue Knight) from the hands of her, who wiſheth all increaſe of glorie vnto you, and ſuch worthie praiſe, as your vertue doth deſerue and merit.</p>
               <p>This little ſpeech was of greater force to conquer this ſtout Knight, then were all the Launces of his enemies, for hee was ouercome with the ſame. Whilſt the bright eyes of the Princeſſe, ſerued for fire to kindle affection in his heart, and her ſpeeches were as whirling darts, that pierced quite through the ſame.</p>
               <p>The exceeding great heate that hee had gotten with ſweating on Horſe-backe, and the baſhfull colour that ſeized vpon him, to ſee himſelfe ſo highly commended of this gratious Princeſſe, had painted his face with ſo pure a vermillion Dye, as he ſeemed farre more amiable &amp; louely then before. In ſo much, as ſhe held him to be no leſſe faire then valiant, highly commending him within her ſecret minde, ſeeing him to haue both va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and beautie, the more to make him in euerie part right beautifull.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> viewing the ſweete countenance, and marking the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred ſpeeches of this young Ladie, was greatly troubled inwardly, not knowing how to anſwere her. Yet had it not bene, but that hee doubted he ſhould be noted, how his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour changed too and fro, he had replied on the ſuddaine. Neuertheleſſe, hee thought (come what ſhould of the matter) hee would make her an anſwere, which hee did, with a lowe and trembling voyce, in this ſort.</p>
               <p>Madame, there is no wood ſo wette or greene, but fire will kindle it: So is there no heart ſo ſoft or fearefull, but your Vertue is able to make valiant &amp; couragious. It was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my owne proper ſtrength or force, neither the deſire to carrie away this Prize, that brought mee to be victorious, but it was the onely glorie which I promiſed (vnto my ſelfe) in receiuing it from your Princely hands: From your Princely hands I ſay, who are not inferiour vnto anie in the world, for perfect beautie. For this ſubiect onely, doe I make account of it, deſiring to keep it, as an immortall treaſure, and not becauſe I haue wonne it from ſo manie couragious Knights, or that I highly eſteeme of their valor, but onely, becauſe I knewe that that glorie would be moſt pleaſing vnto mee, when I might vaunt, that I had it beſtowed vpon me, by the hands of the moſt rareſt Princeſſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, of whome (in lieu of ſo great a recompence) I doe, and will, account my ſelfe for euer, the moſt faithfull ſlaue and vaſſall, and her moſt loyall ſeruant.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpake the braue <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> (for more he could not as then ſpeak, as he was moſt willing) becauſe he was compaſſed round about with manie Gallants, all which, came to honour him, and to reioyce with him, of his good Fortune: ſo as hee was forced to leaue his Miſtris for that time, and for that he was in great Triumph, conducted vnto the King, who cauſed him (onely to grace him the more) to ſit by him, as if he had bene his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and equall.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace the Reuells and Dauncing beganne in the Court, in which ſports my Maiſter would needs be one, where he ſhewed him ſelfe as dainty a Reueler, as he had (in the Liſts) performed the part of a valiant Soldiour, whilſt in theſe Courtly ſportes, the young Princeſſe bare away the Prize, which ſo much pleaſed him, as after that time, the faire <hi>Infant</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was all his ioy.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Achilles</hi> (nere ſo much) lou'd <hi>Briſeis</hi> ſo faire,</l>
                  <l>For whome, (to quarrell ſo) hee then, did dare.</l>
               </q>
               <p>His eies were (ſtill) fixed vpon hers, he delighting in nothing ſo much, as to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her <hi>Angelicall</hi> face. And as the couetous mizer, can neuer turn his looks from his gold, but muſt aiwaies be ſtaring vpon the ſame, ſo our knight did nothing but conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate and behold his ſweet Miſtris. As that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who being extreamly hot, &amp; calling for drink, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame to be maruelous good &amp; pleaſing vnto his taſt, althogh it proue afterward
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15406:154"/>to be full of deadly poyſon: Euen ſo, this couragious follower of <hi>Mars,</hi> ouerheated with Loue, ſore longing and thirſting after the heauenly feature of his Kings Daughter, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe moſt mortall poyſon ſweetly, which by his eyes, ſlipt downe into his heart, and there impoyſoned him.</p>
               <p>As the way-faring man perceiueth his force to faile, and his life to ſteale away, as ſoone as euer the venemous Baſiliſque hath looked vpon him. Euen ſo this poore Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, found his heart and ſoule to be reft violently from him, through the dartes which were glaunced at him, from the ſparkling eyes of the Princeſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>LOVE,</hi> hauing gotten the vpper hand ouer <hi>Mars,</hi> learned <hi>Don Iohn</hi> a new leſſon; making him to ſubmit himſelfe vnto his lawes, changing in him, his former hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, his nature, and his complexion.</p>
               <p>As the Horſcourſer, in breaking a young Colt, brideleth him of his wonted liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, forcing him to carrie his head, to runne, to turne, and then to ſtand ſtill againe, and all as he thinkes good, and at his owne pleaſure: Euen ſo was my kind Maiſter brought vnder, to doe what Loue commaunded him.</p>
               <p>A ſweet kinde of humor, that he ſupped vp, at his eyes, deſcended downe into his heart, a new deſire or wiſh oppreſſed his ſoule, and ſtraunge and vncoth paſſions conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tormented him: and yet he is ſo vnfortunate, as he findeth his ſicknes to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſweete vnto him, whilſt hee honoureth his enemie, and refuſeth all helpe and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Night beeing come, euery one betaketh himſelfe to his quiet reſt. Onely <hi>Don Ihon</hi> who was both victor, and vanquiſhed, was depriued of his ſleepe. At too too high a rate, did hee buy the Prize, which he got in the Laſtes, and happie had he bene, if he had bene ouercome in running; ſo he had not bene conquered by the beautious eyes of his Ladie. For ſo he might perhaps haue recouered his credit another time, hauing manie companions in his diſcomfiture: whereas now, hee was ouercome for euer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his loſſe was vnrecouerable: and ſhee, that had conquered him, was not (againe) to be ouecome by his power or might any way at all. He finding his Prize to haue coſt him too deere, in that he loſt his former libertie, and the freedome of his heart for the ſame.</p>
               <p>He reſembled that Pilot, who ſeeth his Shippe to leake, and full of holes, by which, the water entereth, and therefore diſpaireth of life. And ſuch a one, was our wretched Conquerour, who ſaw no remedie for him, to quench this fire, which burned his inward entrailes.</p>
               <p>Hee was in loue with a Princeſſe, the onely daughter of his King, and whome, the greateſt Monarks of the world, would haue thought themſelues fortunate, to haue had her for wiſe, and who was ſo vertuous and wiſe, as hardly could ſhe be induced vnto <hi>Loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Yet, his misfortunes take to them, a larger ſcope,</l>
                  <l>Hee giues not ore to Loue, though he is without hope.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But after he hath conſidered within himſelfe (wiſely) of the matter, he findeth, that it is but meere follie, to ſet vp his reſt at that game anie longer, and therfore hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to giue it ouer. But the more he thinketh to forget his Loue, the more Affection kindeleth within. Not vnlike the Byrd, who being taken in the lime-twigges, the more ſhe ſtriueth to get away, the more ſhe is intangled.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, one day he being alone, calleth for mee, and becauſe he knewe I had ſome (experience in Loue) he demaunded my aduiſe therein, diſcouering his wound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, and crauing my beſt counſell.</p>

Beſides, I diſcourſed vnto him, of the bloody outragiouſnes of Loue (often) ſighing, as I reported the ſame vnto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as then) I remembred mine olde loue in <hi>Arcadia.</hi>

               <p>Hee hearing me ſay ſo, ſtrait belieued me, determining with himſelfe, not to follow his faire Miſtris any longer in chaſe: and with that reſolution (willing mee to depart) he layeth him downe vpon his bedde, thinking to take his reſt for a while. But no ſooner

Euen ſo, my perplexed Lord, after hee hath done what he can to subdue his paſſion, and yet cannot: at the laſt, ſeeing no other remedie, he reſolueth to loue, and to ſubmit himſelfe, vnder the ſeruile yoake of curſed <hi>Cupid.</hi> Or as the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue, hauing eſcaped in the night, determineth with himſelfe to be followed after in the day time, chaungeth his aduiſe, and frighted with extreame feare, returneth home vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> hee is (in the ende) forced to acknowledge proud <hi>LOVE,</hi> for his ſoueraigne Lord, and is glad to yeeld vnto him.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, he calleth mee againe vnto him, making me priuie vnto his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſcourſing ſtill of Loue, (and flattering himſelfe) he would needes perſwade mee that Loue was courteous and gentle, when hee knew right well (in his owne conſcience) that he did finde him otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But I, on the other ſide, wiſh him not to belieue ſo, but rather aduiſe him to baniſh Loue from him, as one that is an aduerſarie, both vnto his life and quietnes; deliuering vnto him many proofes of the crueltie of that blinde God, and of his villainous nature.</p>
               <p>All this he heareth, although hee knoweth not what to anſwere vnto the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſpake but reaſon, and yet for all this (ſuch was his miſhap) as like an obſtinate and ſelfe-wild man) he ſtandeth ſtill in his blind error ſtiffely.

                     <l>Each Louer, that is burned with this amorous flame,</l>
                     <l>In word and deed, dependeth on his louely Dame.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Not long had hee ſtayed in the Court, but that it was his good Fortune, to haue a ſight of his Miſtriſſe, whome he thought to be wonderfullie inereaſed in Beautie, ſince (laſt) hee ſaw her; ſo as if ſhee then deſerued to be honored as a Ladie, why now, ſhee merited to be worſhipped and adored, as if ſhee had bene ſome Goddeſſe indeed: And thus his affection increaſeth more and more. On the other ſide, the young Princeſſe began to feele a kinde of alteration within her ſelfe, and found her heart to fancie <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> aboue all men liuing: Yea, and ſo much, as ſhe thought he deſerued to haue her
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15406:155"/>Loue, before anie other. And yet when ſhe remembred her Royall birth, whoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was, and the greatnes of her honour, ſhee beganne ſomewhat to forget him: ſo as her deſire was no ſooner lightned, but that it was quenched againe. Not vnlike vnto thoſe children, borne before their time, who no ſooner are brought into the world, but they ſtraitway die.</p>
               <p>Meane time, the Knight, who was not ſo bad a ſcholler in Loues ſchoole, but that he had learned ſome leſſons therein, beganne to gather, by the ſtealing glaunces which ſhe caſt vpon him, that ſhee did not altogether hate him, and therefore beganne to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe, that he was likely to haue ſome good ſucceſſe in his amorous buſines.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, hee thought to venture to ſpeake vnto her. For (ſaid he, vnto him ſelfe) what ſhould hinder me that I ſhould not bewray how much I affect her? What though ſhee be the Daughter of my King? is it reaſon therefore, that I ſhould die for her, and yet not make her acquainied with my death, and the cauſe thereof?</p>
               <p>What know I, whether Loue hath infected her, as well as it hath poyſoned mee? Fot as great Princes (as ſhee) haue felt his force, and haue bene brought vnder by him: which (if it were ſo) I would not then doubt, but that ſhee would be ſo gratious vnto me, as to take ſome pittie vpon mee. For Loue makes the hearts of great Monarks to ſtoope, as well as thoſe of poore peaſants: forcing as well the braueſt minds to be ſubiect vnto his lawes, as ſuch as are baſer perſons. Did not he make ſoft and gentle, the hart of proud and haughtie <hi>Achilles,</hi> compelling him to yeeld vnto his priſoner <hi>Briſeis</hi> to like her ſo well, as hee quarrelled with all the Princes of <hi>Greece,</hi> to haue her good will?</p>
               <p>And the ſelfe ſame Loue, did it not take downe the ſtubborne ſtomacke of high minded <hi>Angelica,</hi> who although ſhe were a Princeſſe, and ſought vnto, by all the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Paladines,</hi> and men of renowne in the world: yet did ſhe caſt her liking vpon ſillie <hi>Medor,</hi> a ſimple Page or Lackey. Nothing can withſtand his mightie power, neither King nor Queene, Royaltie nor Nobilitie, all are alike vnto him, and all muſt doe as he pleaſeth. Onely, with ſurlie and proud mindes, doth he (moſt commonly) adorne his triumphant Chariot, diſdaining (as it were) the ſpoyles of the meaneſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, did not <hi>Venus</hi> doate on a Shepheard? and <hi>Phoebus,</hi> vpon a plaine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Laſſe? Yes, yes, and therefore nothing is impoſſible vnto Loue.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is ſo, I will endeuour to ſee, if I can learne, whether hee hath tamed the great heart of this louely Princeſſe: which if he hath done, I hope then, that it is ſtrucken with a golden Dart, as mine is, and not with one of lead.</p>
               <p>Might I but once finde that ſhe affecteth mee, I would doe well enough with the reſt, hoping (in time) to bring euery thing to a moſt proſperous end, and happie iſſue.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid my Maiſter, being reſolute to ſound the depth of the Princeſſe thoughts, and yet hee thought it was hard to wade through ſuch a Foord, much doubting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance therein, but farre more, how to get out (thereof) againe.</p>
               <p>And as a Generall of an Armie, after hee hath had manie parleyes with the Fort, which is enemie vnto him, pitcheth his Tentes round about the ſame: but ſeeing his Souldiers to be beatten backe againe, with loſſe of many of his men, diſpaireth that he ſhall not be able to ſurprize it, doubting ſore of ſome bad iſſue in this his enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, many doubts ran into <hi>Don Iohns</hi> head, which much troubled him, as well, he knew not what to doe. One while he feareth leſt he ſhould offend his Miſtris, and loth he is to diſpleaſe her: yet in the end, <hi>Fortune,</hi> who fauoreth ſuch as be venturous, egged him forward, making the way plain for him, that he might the better bewray his affection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Ladie. For one day, the King being willing highly to grace him, commanded him to ſit downe with him, at his owne Royall table, where his daughter fat, right ouer againſt him. Neuer can Vertue be honoured too much, whilſt ſhee doeth credit vnto them, that thus ſeeke to doe her reuerence and dutie.</p>
               <p>I leaue vnto your aduiſed conſiderations, to iudge, whether (whileſt the Princeſſe ſate ſo nigh the Knight) he loſt anie time or no? And whether hee tooke his occaſion, finding the opportunitie ſo fitte: if hee had done otherwiſe, he had done fondlie.</p>
               <p>But hee, ſeeing his Saint ſo nigh (vnto him) watching fitte time, after many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conceits running in his minde, with a bluſhing countenance, and a low trembling voyee, hee thus beganne to Court her.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:15406:155"/>
               <p>What would you ſay (moſt excellent Princes) to heare, that your owne knight vpon the ſelfeſame day, in which he receiued from your royall ſelfe, the prize for Tilting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both victorious, and vanquiſht, and all at once? Victor ouer ſo many braue Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, but vanquiſht) through your moſt beautious eyes.</p>
               <p>And although euery Conquerour, is proud of his conqueſt, and he that is conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, lamenteth for his loſſe: yet I (quite contrarie vnto them) eſteeme leſſe of my vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, then I doe to be ouercome: for, it is far more honourable to be ouerthrowne by a diuine puyſſance, then to be Conquerour ouer a weeke and feeble force.</p>
               <p>And what greater renowme, or brauer fame, may ſo much beautifie and adorne my daies, as to be called the vaſſall, and ſlaue of her, and to be vanquiſht by her, who by the ſame force, is able to ouercome, euen the Gods themſelues. No other glorie will I ſeeke then this, which is, to be accounted your Captiue.</p>
               <p>I know (good Madame) you may count me ouer arragant, and without diſcretion, in that I dare preſume, to vſe ſuch ſpeeches vnto you, who are both my naturall Princes, and my Ladie, purchaſed through your too beautious eyes; yet though the Gods be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and immortall, they for all that, refuſe not the ſeruice of worldly men their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe nothing can hinder vertue from doing her duetie, inaſmuch as ſhe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault: and the rather, in that ſhe is of force, to make the fierce and wildeſt hearts that are to be in loue with her.</p>
               <p>I ſpeake not this, that I would looke for any recompence for my paines of you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you ſhould make any account of me at all: onely I would moſt humble entreat you, that you would vouchſafe to belieue, that all my deſires, all my ſtudies, and all my endeuours, are wholy vowed vnto your ſecret ſeruice, and that no perſon ſhall command ouer my ſoule, but onely your ſweet ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thinke not then gratious Princes, that I am ouer-raſh, and too too bold, to deliuer ſuch words, as theſe vnto you. For it is impoſſible that any right generous minde, or braue heroicall thought, ſhould ſee ſo rare and matchleſſe a beautie as yours is; but that he needs muſt be in loue therewith; and louing it, deuote himſelfe vnto the honour of the ſame for euer. Did not ſo many diuine vertues abound within you, and were you, not euery way, indued with ſo rare and exquiſite qualities as you are, we then ſhould not ſo earneſtly ſeeke to ſerue you: neither ſhould we be ſo curious to follow you, with ſo great affection and reſpect as we doe.</p>
               <p>Sooner ſhall the Sunne be without light, and the earth, without verdure and greenes, for as the heauens (whether we will or no) giueth vnto vs light: Euen ſo, deſpite of your ſelfe, ſhall you be honoured and admired, as long as you are ſo excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a creature.</p>
               <p>Then, if I place my ſelfe, in the order of ſuch as reuerence your rare qualities, good Madam pardon me: neither thinke that any perſon, can bare more loyall ſeruice vnto you, then I my ſelfe doe: for might my death teſtifie the ſame any way, I proteſt I would more willingly die, then line. I crauing nor wiſhing any thing ſo much in this world, as your pleaſure and contentment.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaid <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> trembling for very feare: ſo as he whom the valour of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemie he had, could not ſo much as once daunt or terrifie, he not knowing what it was to feare a bloodie aduerſarie) doth now quake and lookepale, ſitting before a ſillie Virgin, yea he ſtandeth more in awe of her, then of a whole oaſt of armed men.</p>
               <p>The young Princes, who was alreadie perſwaded by Loue, to entertaine him into her amorous ſeruice, to the end ſhe might the better taſt how ſweet a pleaſure it was, and what great credit, to be attended on, by noble Spirits (who moſt commonly are conquerours ouer ſuch as be haughtie &amp; proud) found her hart to be more mollified and ſoftned, by reaſon of this Oration, which my Maiſter had made vnto her, whileſt as the Bird is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the ſweet pipe of the fowler, ſo was ſhe ouercome, with the pleaſing harmonie of his mellifluous tongue.</p>
               <p>But yet, as that Captaine, who rendereth vp his Sconce (to ſaue his honour) firſt ſuffereth the Cannon to be brought thither to batter the ſame, becauſe he will not haue the world to thinke, that timerous feare, but rather default of ſuccour, brought him
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15406:156"/>vnto this extremitie. Euen ſo, the Princes ment not to be wonne ſo ſoone, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring her royall birth and calling, and withall, her vertuous diſpoſition and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable bringing vp, thought (firſt) with ſome ſhort ſpeech to anſwere her Knight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as if ſhe had bene angry with him. Great perſonages (for the moſt part) vſe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conicall</hi> breuitie in their diſcourſes, their words being farre more pretious, and of more worth, then thoſe of the common ſort of people are, and therfore ought to be the more accounted of.</p>
               <p>Thus then did the Princes <hi>Maria</hi> replie vnto him. That man worthily is denied of his deſire, that demandeth a thing vniuſt, or what is contrarie vnto the lawes, being by the ſame lawe, condemned either to make ſome amends, or endure ſome kind of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The haughtie minde, who like <hi>Phacton,</hi> would ſoare to high, is not lamented when he falleth, being plagued for his pride; ſeeing none ſhould flie, that haue not wings, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought any to intermeddle with that which belongeth vnto Kings, except he be roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally borne. Shouldeſt thou be chaſtiſed with ſo grieuous puniſhment, for this thy too much ſawcie, and raſh enterpriſe, thou wert but ſerued rightly: for I would haue thee to know, that one of mine eſtate, of my honour and reputation, is not ſo eaſie wonne, or changed, as euery winde changeth and moueth the waues of the Seas too and fro.</p>
               <p>Neither haddeſt thou any ſuch neede, to make ſo long a preamble in thy ſpeech, in offering of thy ſeruice vnto me, when in nature and dutie, thou art bound vnto me, to ſerue me, and this thou doeſt promiſe to doe, vpon hope (forſooth) that thou maieſt bring me to yeeld vnto thy deſire: but vpon this condition, I refuſe both it, and thy ſelfe: for I will not onely hate vice, but all occaſions, whereby I may be induced to be brought vnto the ſame.</p>
               <p>Henceforth, then learne to be more wiſe, and thinke thy ſelfe happie, that thou maieſt this once eſcape ſcotfree, for this thy preſumptuous boldnes.</p>
               <p>This was the choake peare, which the Princes gaue vnto <hi>Don Iohn</hi> to ſwallow, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, whatſoeuer ſhe ſpake, ſhe ment far otherwiſe, wiſhing vnto him, as well as to her owne ſelfe. Sage and prudent was that Phyloſopher, who deſired, that man might carrie a window in his breſt, the better to know: what he thought, and what he ment in heart: which if it were ſo, there ſhould not then be ſo many horrible treaſons committed, neither ſuch damned deeds perpetrated and put in practiſe as now they are. But here belowe is little or no perfection at all, the moſt part of men paſſing away their liues, without doing any commendable act at all.</p>
               <p>But now our knight, thinking his Miſtris had ment as ſhe ſpake (forgetting that it is the nature of women now and then to diſſemble) thought her to be his mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and was ſo daunted withall, as he ſat like a moueleſſe Rocke, not able to anſwere her one word, ſo much had griefe ſeazed vpon his tongue, diſpaire aſſailing his heart, and ſhame (for being denied) making him looke pale and bloodleſſe in the face.</p>
               <p>As that maiſter of a ſhip, is amazed and ſad, when he ſeeth the weather, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to change, quite contrarie vnto the warrant, he had not long before giuen vnto his Paſſengers; whileſt they in the meane time, caſt in his teeth the ſmaller skill and knowledge he hath in his art, he not well knowing what to anſwere them againe: Euen ſo it fared with my maiſter, who was quite blanke, and knew not what to ſay vnto this matter. In ſo much, as had any at that table knowne of his loue, or but heard what ſhe had ſaid, they might eaſily haue geſſed what the matter was, by his very countenance, but none knew it, neither would be diſcouer it vnto any, but onely vnto me alone.</p>
               <p>But the Princes, who doubted that either her lookes, which ſhe forced to ſhew frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and diſcontent, or elſe the ſharpe ſpeech ſhe gaue vnto him, would (perhaps) make him to doe ſomewhat, which afterward might cauſe her to beſhrow her ſelfe, chiefely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſecret good will ſhe bare him in her ſoule (which was of more efficacie and force, then all other conſiderations whatſoeuer) began now to repent her, that ſhe had taken him vp ſo ſhort, and therefore, determined with her ſelfe to make him amends with another, far more cur teous then the firſt, when (as ſhe beginning) the cloth was taken vp, and the feaſt done, ſo that ſhe was conſtrained (though much againſt her will) to riſe, and leaue her Knight.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:15406:156"/>
               <p>As that woman, who being taken tardie in ſome fault by her husband, ſtandeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and ſad, in ſome corner of one chamber or other, whileſt the reſt of the houſhold are merrie and pleaſant together: Euen ſo, mine vnfortunate Lord, whileſt all the other Gallants of the Court, were dauncing, ſpeaking, and diſcourſing pleaſantly one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſtood moſt heauily, lamenting his hard fortune vnto himſelfe alone.</p>
               <p>No maruaile then, although euery one was aſtomſht, and wondered to ſee ſo ſudden an alteration in him, looking ſo pittifully, eſpecially, when there was nothing wanting vnto him, but that he might be rather more blyth and pleaſant then others, he hauing receiued ſo many honours (by reaſon of the prize he had gotten) both of the King and all the Court.</p>
               <p>But (to this) he might haue anſwered them, as that noble Romane did, who (hauing put his wife away) could giue no other reaſon vnto them, that although his ſhooe was fine, and well made for his foote, yet did not any knowe, whereabouts it wrung him, but onely himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> ſelt himſelfe grieued, yet none could tell the nature of his diſeaſe, but onely ſhe, who might if ſo ſhe pleaſed, haue bene his Phyſition, and yet was it not ſo grieuous vnto him, but that it was farre worſe to her ſelfe: ſhe repenting her ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times and often, for her froward and tart words, and ſeeking all meanes poſſible, to make amends for the ſame, although as then ſhe could not. Alacke, how ſoone and quickly, doth ſpeech paſſe from vs, and how terrible doe it ſting oftentimes, when a word is ſo bitterly ſpoken, as it cutteth and pierceth more deeper, then a ſharpe and keene ſword?</p>
               <p>It was not for nothing, that the auncient Sages, had a certaine Goddeſſe, they called <hi>Silence,</hi> which alwaies held her finger vpon her mouth, to giue vs to vnderſtand therby, that without long premeditating, and bethinking vs well of the matter, which we ment to deliuer, we ſhould not ſpeake at all, for feare leaſt as the Poet ſaith,
<q>
                     <l>That thy raſh ſpeech make thee for to repent,</l>
                     <l>Which at vnwares moſt fondly from thee went.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That great Commander ouer the whole armie of the Gretians, who ouercame <hi>Troy</hi> repented him many a time and often of his too raſh promiſe, for he hauing vowed moſt ſolemnly vnto the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> to facrifice the faireſt and goodlieſt thing in all his Realme, vpon condition ſhe would beappeaſed, and plague the Gretian Campe no more, was conſtrained (for performance of what he had ſo religiouſly proteſted) to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his owne daughter, then who, there was none fairer. So likewiſe did thoſe Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, repent them of their words, who ſold vnto that Phyloſopher, the counterfait of a Virgin, in which they brought the Triuet of gold, which was placed in the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> And ſo was that good Iudge <hi>Iepha,</hi> ſorrie, in that he had ſo vnaduiſedly, promiſed vnto God, to ſacrifice the firſt thing which he ſhould meete comming from his owne houſe, as he ſhould returne homeward, if he ſhould obtaine the conqueſt ouer his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for his onely child and daughter was ſhe, of whom he firſt had a ſight of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſhe put to death.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon our young Princes, being ſorie that ſhe had done amiſſe, ſought to amend the ſame, when though faine ſhe would, yet then ſhe could not.</p>
               <p>And now the whole companie being readie to depart, beautious <hi>Maria</hi> caſt a moſt louely looke vpon her Seruant, to giue him (in full fatisfaction of her former iniuries done vnto him) a certaine aſſurance, as well of her Loue towards him, as of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for what ſhe had vttered before. But he, that now had entertained blacke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire within his minde, and who dreamed vpon nothing, but on horror and death, neuer marked her, nor perceiued any ſuch gratious ſigne, and therefore it did him no good at all: no more then a little weake potion, is able to counterchecke and encounter, with a deadly poyſon, that is mortally entred into the ſtomacke, and euery part of a man.</p>
               <p>And as ſmall and ordinarie remedies, are ſufficient to helpe a man to his health, who being but newly fallen ſicke, but are of no force nor vertue at all, when he is growne to

Eeuen ſo, theſe amorous geſtures and ſignes of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which before the mortall infirmitie of my maiſter, had bene comfortable vnto him, and had done him much good, comming (now too late) ſtood him in no ſteed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as then, like one that diſpaired of his life.</p>
               <p>Night being come, he commeth home heauie and ſad, none knowing the occaſion thereof but my ſelfe: he himſelfe, not being able, or at leſtwiſe, ſomewhat vnwilling to deliuer his misfortune vnto me, but I hauing knowne the ſame, came (of mine owne accord) vnto him, ſeeking to comfort him, by all the deuiſes I could, therewithall tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that the firſt entring into Loue, was the hardeſt: and that if a braue Generall of a field, for one repulſe or two, would neuer giue ouer his enterpriſe, but rather follow it harder, yea and that with ſo deſperate a courage, as in the end he returned conquerour, then much leſſe ought he to be daunted, or diſtruſt his owne good hap, although at the firſt puſh, he had not made a breach into his Ladies heart.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I told him, that what is eaſie obtained, is not worth the getting, whereas that, that is dearely bought, &amp; hardly come by (as moſt commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the affaires in loue be ſuch) are not ſo quickly purchaſt, and therefore he muſt not thinke much, although he endure ſome paine, or labour, before he attaine his ſo much deſired ſuite: for the fruits thereof, are ſo luſcious &amp; ſweet, that if the Louer ſhould gather them, without ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he would growe more proud then the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againe, ſay that women ſhould loue vs, yet were it neither decent, nor iuſt, that they ſhould ſuffer themſelues to be intreated, at the firſt encounter; as well, becauſe their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is ſtill before their eyes, which they hold as the deareſt thing they haue, as alſo, becauſe they doubt, they ſhall be the ſooner diſdained, and deſpiſed by vs, (as fooles and ſuch as want diſcretion and gouernment) if they ſhould (ſo ſoone) make a tender vnto vs of their friendly loue.</p>
               <p>Beſides that, a woman is but courted and attended vpon by the man, but a ſmall time, and whileſt he woeth her, in the way of marriage; for no ſooner are they become man and wife, but that then, ſhe muſt attend, and ſerue him, and this is the reaſon they are ſo long before they will yeeld vnto theſe amorous purſuites &amp; perſwaſions. Withall, we muſt conſider the birth, the calling, and the qualitie of the perſon whom we ſeeke to obtaine, who the nobler ſhe is, the longer (muſt we thinke) it will be before ſhe be brought vnto our lures, eſpecially, when ſhe is our better farre; ſo, as if <hi>Briſeus</hi> (although a ſeruant and Captiue) ſtood ſo much vpon her Pantophles, as ſhe looked that ſhe ſhould be ſued vnto by <hi>Achilles,</hi> her Lord and Maiſter: much more ſhould not he thinke it ſtraunge (and not wonder thereat, at all) although his Miſtris being a Princes borne, would looke for farre more ſeruice at his hands; and therefore he had no reaſon but to be of courage, to plucke vp his ſpirits, and play as that wiſe Captaine doth, who ſeeing himſelfe diſcomfited, preſently gathereth new forces together againe, and once more ventureth his fortune.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other perſwaſions did I vſe vnto him, but the vnfortunate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thinking the (taske he had taken in hand) to be harder for to finiſh (then it was) would receiue no comfort at all, much leſſe any hope to obtaine what he ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; in ſo much as he reſolued, to giue ouer the court for euer, and to goe and liue in a houſe he had in the countrie, where he ment to ſpend the remainder of his loathed life.</p>

               <p>Hauing this conceit in his head, the next morning he commeth vnto the Court, where he taketh his leaue (in humble wiſe) of the King, and that he might haue a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for his departure, and that none might ſuſpect his heauie countenance, he maketh them beleeue, his mother was at the poynt of death, and therefore he being ſent for, muſt

               <p>Hauing bene with the King, he commeth vnto the Queene, and to her faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnto whom he telleth this ſad newes, looking very ſorrowfully, and ſo moſt humbly taketh his leaue of them; but the young Princes, geſſing ſhroadly at the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that there was no ſuch thing, but onely a meere excuſe, grieued mightily, to heare how ſhe ſhould loſe his companie, the onely cauſe wherof ſhe knew her ſelfe to be; for which, although ſhe was hartily forie, yet knew ſhe no way how to remedie as then the ſame.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> moſt pittifully conſumed away, as well becauſe he wanted his Miſtris, as alſo for that he was neuer likely to ſee her any more, whileſt he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired vnto his melancolike houſe reſolued to die, and to giue ouer the world.</p>
               <p>O cruell madnes, O furious rage, O incomparable miſchiefe, O miſerie, none ſo great as Loue. What worſer misfortune can happen vnto a man, then for want of reaſon, to ſuffer himſelfe to fall into the mercileſſe hands of his murthering foe?</p>
               <p>And what vnhappines (be it neuer ſo great) can ouerthrow a man ſo ſoone, as that which depriueth him of all ſenſe, and vnderſtanding? for the loſſe of our beſt friends, or chiefeſt goods, are eaſily to be borne, becauſe ſeldome or neuer they make vs loſe our right wits for them: but the torments we ſuffer in Loue, are inſupportable and not to be endured; for it confoundeth our vertue and conſtancie, as was too well ſeene by <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who would not take comfort in any thing, but onely in death: whileſt lying thus dangerouſly ſicke, of a ſecret diſeaſe of the minde, he was ſo much changed, as none could well haue knowne him; for his goodly and comely perſonage, was become pale, weake, and earthly: his haire long, wilde and feltred: his eyes, hollow and deepe, ſetled in his head: his face heauie and ſad: his cheekes hollow and leane: his lips dead like aſhes, and dried vp for want of moyſture: his breaſts lanke, and without fleſh: his hands, but skinne and boane, and his armes brawne fallen, and without any force at all: to be briefe, he reſembled rather a dead Anatomie, then a liuing creature.</p>
               <p>And although diuers haue bene of an opinion, that hardly or neuer any can die for Loue, becauſe (as they ſay) this amorous ſickenes, tainteth the ſoule onely (which is not ſubiect vnto death) and not the mortall bodie; yet neuertheleſſe for all this, there is no doubt, but that many haue ſo died, and that the ſoule (as a companion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in the ſelfeſame functions) cannot feele any griefe, but that the bodie muſt feele his part thereof, and except he be partaker of the ſame, euen (as one day) both the one and the other ſhall be partners either of eternall glorie, or elſe of euerlaſting fire, in that they haue bene companions in this world, either of good or elſe of euill. Such a life then was this which our poore <hi>Arragonian</hi> Gentleman endured, a life ordinarie and common vnto ſuch, who depriued of all hopefull happines, pine away like one that is in a recure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conſumption, for nothing maketh vs to liue, but onely ioyfull hope, which if it be deferred long, it maketh vs languiſh, but much more then will it plague vs, if we once growe in diſpaire, neuer to obtaine the ſame.</p>
               <p>And therefore, there is none ſo wretched a life, as that which weareth away for want of hope: and ſo liued miſerable <hi>Phedra,</hi> who ſeeing her deare <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> dead (for want of hope) ſlew her ſelfe. For as the Poet ſaith,
<q>
                     <l>Sweet hope, the life of euery one (what ere) doth cheriſh,</l>
                     <l>And were it not for wiſht for hope, all men would periſh.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This then was my Maiſters reſolution, which no man could dehort him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All his houſe, and chambers were painted with blacke, our Liueries being tawnie, and in the roome where he lay, he cauſed diuers melancholicke and ſad ſentences, to be drawne in great Characters, all which were the Infants of diſpaire. One day, he being ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his vſuall cuſtome was, called for pen and Inke, and thereupon compoſed theſe ſad verſes following, which he would oftentimes ſing vnto his Lute.</p>

                  <l>I die, but in what ſort, alas my woes ſo many be,</l>
                  <l>As neuer any heretofore, hath ſuffered like to me.</l>
                  <l>Happie is he that to his end by one ſure ſtroke doth hie,</l>
                  <l>To languiſh (dying) is far worſe, then quickly for to die.</l>

                  <l>Like Captiue am I led away, yet can I not behold</l>
                  <l>Her face, to whom I priſoner am, and who my hart controld.</l>
                  <l>He is no valiant Souldiour right, nor any Conquerour braue,</l>
                  <l>Who to his priſoner dares not ſhowe himſelfe, when he doth craue.</l>
                  <l>But heauens I ſee conſpire gainſt me, this life I finiſh muſt,</l>

                  <l>He happie dieth, who in the would hath liued without hope.</l>

               <p>This was the melancolicke Muſicke, which my luckleſſe Maiſter ſung vnto his Lute, making all thoſe heauie, that were hearers of the ſame. O male-contented ſorrow, thou woundeſt our ſoules through ſadnes, neuer ſuffering vs to reſt quietly; thou drieſt vp the marrow in our bones, whereas ioy delighteth and comforteth the heart.</p>
               <p>Through thee, and through thy blacke ſiſter diſpaire, died conſtant <hi>Portia, Cato</hi> the Cenſors daughter, and modeſt <hi>Octauia,</hi> the patient wife of that luxurious <hi>Marke Anthonie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to our former diſcourſe, and leaue all digreſſions by the way, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> had no ſooner left the Court, but that the young Princes <hi>Maria,</hi> was readie to leaue her life, taking on moſt pittifully, now ſhe had loft the ſight of him, whom ſhe moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>For as the fire put vnder a heape of wood (although greene) after it groweth to be drie &amp; fit to burne, kindleth moſt ſtrangely, caſting forth huge flames, moſt dreadfull to behold: Euen ſo, the heart of Princely <hi>Maria,</hi> which Loue had not yet lighted but onely a little (becauſe it began to reſiſt ſomewhat at the firſt) after it was once throughly dried by deſire, began to kindle ſo extremely within her afterward, as ſhe was mightily burned with the ſame, inſomuch, that ſhe grewe ſo ſtrongly enamored of her louing Seruant, as ſhe could no longer liue without his preſence.</p>
               <p>Great is the danger of that man, that openeth a gap vnto his aduerſarie, whereby he may take aduantage of him, eſpecially vnto that cruell tormentor Loue; who, worſe then any barbarous Tyrant ſpoyleth vs, ouerthroweth vs, &amp; treadeth vs vnder his feete: for ſo did this comfortleſſe Ladie finde him, who now with teares from her eyes, and ſighes from her heart, many a thouſand times repented her of her ouerfond ouerſight,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15406:158"/>in being the Author of ſo much miſerie, as well vnto her friend, as vnto her owne ſelfe. Faine would ſhee now redeeme the ſpeeches which (before) ſhe had ſpoken, but it was then too late, although ſhe oftentimes curſed her tongue for the ſame.</p>
               <p>A bitter Pill of digeſtion is Repentance, and thrice happie is hee, that neuer hath had occaſion to ſay <hi>(I Repent mee,)</hi> onely the ancient Sages, (fewe in number) might iuſtly ſpeake the ſame. For that man needeth not to be ſorrie at all, who doeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing without mature aduiſe, and ſound deliberation of iudgement.</p>
               <p>But as a ſtorme neuer commeth without raine or haile, ſo neuer anie misfortune happeneth alone, but ſomewhat elſe commeth with it. For during the time that the Princeſſe ſo much bewailed the abſence of my loyall Maiſter, it ſo fell out, that the Prince of <hi>Lions,</hi> demaunded her in marriage of the King her Father, who preſentlie gaue his conſent, ſo that there wanted nothing, but (onely this) that the Princeſſe ſhould agree vnto this match her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But ſhee, who could not diſpoſe of her owne heart, becauſe ſhee had beſtowed it on another, and was fully minded, neuer to be wedded vnto anie, except vnto <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> thought within her ſelfe, rather to leaue the world, then to yeeld vnto any ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, her Father and Mother importuned her wonderfully; the amorous Prince himſelfe, not looſing anie time or opportunitie to winne her, by all the deuiſes he could.</p>
               <p>As in the middeſt of a terrible fight vpon the Sea, the Admirall ſeeing his Shippe ſet on fire, his enemies got therein, and his people ſlaine, knoweth not well what to doe, or what to reſolue vpon: whether it were beſt to die by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Euen ſo, and in ſuch perplexitie, (if not worſe) was royall <hi>Maria.</hi> Counſell and aduiſe ſhee wanted, what to ſay or doe ſhee knewe not, and which way to turne her, ſhe was ignorant; ſhee waileth and weepeth, wiſheth to die, and calleth for death, and yet findeth nothing to helpe her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hecuba,</hi> neuer bewailed her bondage ſo much, nor the murthering of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither did <hi>Niobe</hi> mone ſo rufullie, for her misſo: tune, as this poore Virgin ſighed and tooke on for her hard happe: whilſt <hi>LOVE,</hi> one while counſelleth her one thing, another while, wiſheth her to doe another; and yet in the ende doeth not permit her to reſolue vpon any matter throughly. Shee in the meane time ſtanding doubtfull, and wauering what to doe, like a veſſell that is toſſed too and fro with a Tempeſt. O how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did ſhe wiſh and deſire within her ſelfe, to ſee (but once before ſhee died) her deareſt friend, that ſhe might craue pardon of him, for her fault.</p>
               <p>Nothing doth ſhe couet ſo much as death, and (yet ſuch was her ill hap) as ſhe knew not how to die. In the ende, after ſhe had bebated the matter within her ſelfe, and beate her braines too and fro therein, ſhe found no better meanes, then to haue recourſe vnto <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and to intreat him to haue compaſſion on her: but then ſhe was (almoſt) at her wittes end, to thinke how ſhe might make him acquainted with her purpoſe: When flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>Fortune,</hi> (for her ill luck) ſhewed her, how ſhe might bring this her buſines about well, and as ſhe her ſelfe would deſire.</p>
               <p>For the young Prince of <hi>Lions,</hi> who was in the prime of his youth, and in the heate of his chiefe blood, ſeeing he could not by faire meanes obtaine the King of <hi>Arragons</hi> daughter, thought to trie what hee could doe by force: and therevpon, ſent an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador vnto the King, that if he would not willingly yeeld his daughter vnto his wife, he (then) would haue her from him perforce, and by bloodie warres.</p>
               <p>The King hearing this proud Meſſage, as one that was loth to force his onely daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or compell her to marrie againſt her will, &amp; yet withall, fearing (ſomewhat) the power of his arrogant Foe, thought to make as ſure worke as hee could in this matter; and therevpon, ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Princeſſe hauing eſpied ſo fitte an occaſion, ſent a truſtie Page of her owne vnto him, with (her incloſed Letter) in great ſecret, but before he had receiued the ſame,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15406:159"/>the Kings Officers had poſted vnto him where he lay, certifying him of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement; But hee that had vowed vnto himſelfe, neuer to returne into the world more: and finding himſelfe ſo feeble and weake, as hee was quite without all force or ſtrength, denied the Princeſſes requeſt, minding to excuſe himſelfe by reaſon of his ſicknes, and ſo to ſend them away: which hee had no ſooner done, but behold his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris Page came preſentlie, to enter into his Chamber, and to deliuer her Letter vnto him.</p>
               <p>As that man (who thinking himſelfe to be healthfull and ſtrong in bodie) is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with feare, when ſuddenly (and in the beſt of his time) a ſtraunge kinde of Qualme, commeth ouer his ſtomack, and an vncoth trembling is found to runne through all his ioyntes and members: Euen ſo, was this ſicke Knight, wonderfullie amazed, to ſee his Ladies Letter, in the middeſt of his miſerie, and when hee was depriued of all ſuch hope, diſpairing euer to haue found ſuch kindneſſe to come from her.</p>

               <p>Wherevpon, hee commaundeth the Chamber to be voyded, when being all alone, (except the Page) hee demaundeth of him what the Princeſſe pleaſure was; who told him, that her earneſt requeſt was, that he would doe her ſo much fauour, as to challenge the Prince of <hi>Lions,</hi> to Combat: and to maintaine in quarrell againſt him, that he ought not, againſt the oath and deuoire of a true Knight, goe about to ſeeke to haue her vnto his wife, againſt her will, which victorie (if it pleaſe God that he obtaine) he then ſhould ſoone finde, how thankfull ſhe would be vnto him for the ſame.</p>
               <p>My maiſter hearing this, was readie to leape out of his skinne for verie ioy, driuing away all ſadneſſe, and becomming merrie, as he was at the firſt, ſeeing he had (now) ſome meanes to ſhewe himſelfe, ſome way worthie of the good will of his Miſtris.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon he anſwered the Page, that (his humble dutie firſt remembred vnto the Princeſſe) hee would be at the Court within tenne dayes after, and ſo willed him to ſignifie, (and to aſſure her thereof: where, in his blacke Armour) ſpread all ouer with
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15406:159"/>burning flames, and drerie leaues, hee would meete his hote and importunate Louer, not doubting, but quicklie to coole his heate and courage: and ſo, beſtowing a rich Iewell vpon the Page, he ſent him backe againe vnto the Princeſſe, who was maruellous glad to heare this newes from him.</p>

               <p>But alas, who euer hath ſeene a Louer, that hath not bene halfe fooliſh? and that would not thinke, but that hee were able to performe things that were impoſſible, for the Loue of his Miſtriſſe? For as the Poet ſaith:

               <p>Neuertheleſſe, hee thought nothing was impoſſible vnto him, as long as it was in the ſeruice of his Ladie, hee beeing of the minde, that in ſuch a cauſe, he was able to conquer all the world.</p>

               <p>Which when the King had heard, hee was wonderfully ſorie, but on the other ſide, the Page warranted the Princeſſe, that (what newes ſo euer hee had ſent vnto the King her Father, becauſe hee would not as then, be knowne of the ſime) that (yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) hee would keepe his word, and not faile of his promiſe: and ſo hee did indeed.

               <p>This was the reaſon that <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> (according vnto his word) kept his day, not miſſing to be there, at the time appointed, and in ſuch an Armour as hee told the Page of, although he was verie weake and ſickly, which if his faire <hi>Maria</hi> had knowne, ſhee would not haue ſo lightly employed him in ſo weightie a buſineſſe, as concerned as well his life, as her owne, and the wel-fare of them both; but rather would haue cauſed him, to take ſome longer time to recouer him ſelfe, and ſome good Phyſicke to make him ſtrong againe.</p>
               <p>And now the day being come, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> (as a Knight errant and vnknowne) Armed (and diſguiſed, as I told you before) preſented himſelfe before the King, and hauing done reuerence vnto him, demaundeth for the Prince of <hi>Lims.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King hearing him ſay ſo, asked what hee would haue with him, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion why hee enquired for him: (my reaſon is, anſwered the Knight, to prooue againſt him, (if ſo it ſhall ſtand with your Highnes good liking) that hee doeth againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and lawes of Chiualrie, to go about to obtaine (the Princeſſe your Daughters loue) rather by force, then by other good meanes: and therevpon, I denounce the Combat vnto him. which if hee refuſe, I will account him no better then a baſe Coward, voyd of all valour, and as as one that is vnworthy of that thrice Noble order of Knighthood.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:15406:160"/>
               <p>Heerevpon the Prince was called, (for hee was come but the day before vnto the Court, hee hauing bene ſent for thither, by a traine that the Princeſſe laide, who knewe her faithfull Seruant would not miſſe his day,) before whome the ſtraunge Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the former wordes: Which the other hearing, was ſo incenſt with rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as preſently hee called for his Horſe and Armour, beeing readie in a trice, and ſo went into the Liſtes to meete with his enemie.</p>
               <p>The King was wonderfullie aſtoniſhed at this ſtraunge aduenture, and yet reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced much in his minde, wiſhing in his heart, and praying vnto God, that this new come Knight might haue the vpper hand, of his proud and inſolent aduerſarie. But if hee ſo much reioyced, then muſt you thinke that the Princeſſe his Daughter, was much more pleaſed and contented, ſeeing her valiant Knight to be ſo true of his word, and ſo readie to aduenture his life for her ſake: &amp; therefore thought him moſt worthy to be beloued.</p>
               <p>And now euerie thing beeing in a readineſſe, the two Combattants entered the field, both of them prouoked, with one and the ſelfe-ſame deſire, and both forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, through extreame Loue.</p>
               <p>The Trumpets ſounding, they ſet ſpurres to their horſes, meeting with ſuch a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble encounter, as their Speares flewe all into ſhiuers, and both of them fell vppon the ground: but quicklie got they vp againe, drawing their naked ſwords, and the one moſt deſperately ſeeking to aſſaile the other.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Cyclops</hi> in <hi>Aetna,</hi> beating continuallie vppon the Iron Forge, fill all the bordering mountaines thereabouts, with Thundering noyſe; Euen ſo, the blowes that fell vpon the Armours of theſe two Champions, made ſuch frightfull noyſe, as the ſound thereof was heard farre and neere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is minded there to die, or to ouercome, ſince hee fighteth in the houour of his Ladie, ſo great is his courage: And yet, thee that was the occaſion of the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his forces, cannot reſtore the ſame vnto him againe, when hee hath moſt need of them for her ſake.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the young Prince madde for anger, that one ſhould take his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris away from him (and againſt his will) whome he beheld to be in place, redoubled his ſtrength and courage in this Combat. But yet it had ſtood him in ſmall ſtead, and to little or no purpoſe at all, if his enemie had bene as ſtrong and luſtie in bodie as he was, before <hi>LOVE</hi> had ſo much weakened and taken him downe. Little oddes ſeemed there to be betwixt theſe two Caualiers, ſo valiantly did both of them carry themſelues, as euery one wondred at them.</p>
               <p>No running tricks in their fighting was forgotten, no Stockado, nor Reuerſchio, no giuing place for aduantage, nor no faſt following, to ſerue their owne purpoſe was miſſing: each of them ſtriuing (as now) to ſhewe the vemoſt skill they had, in this their dangerous play.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Iohn</hi> hurt the Prince in the ſhoulder, and the Prince wounded him in the thigh, which was the cauſe that the Battaile began to beginne a newe betweene them: whilſt the lookers on, were euen wearie to behold them, onely they which fought, were ſo freſh and liuely, as if they had (but as then) entred into the field.</p>
               <p>The Liſts (with their trauerſing vp and downe the ground) are made deepe like fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and ſtrewed all along, with the ſplinters &amp; pieces of their Armours. Vpon part of which, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> (by ill fortune ſtumbling) fell downe, &amp; the Prince preſently vpon him, ready to haue ſtabde him, with his dagger into his throte, which he put in practiſe to the vtmoſt of his force, but his Corſlet was of ſo good proofe, as he could not doe him much hurt. Thus as they tumbled one vpon an other, my Maiſter plaide his part ſo well, as at length he got vp againe on his legges, when as then, he began to find &amp; feele, how much his former ſorrow &amp; griefe of mind had weakned him: beſides, calling to mind his fault, (of which he was ſo aſhamed) hee with ſuch a freſh courage, aſſailed his furious Foe, that he made amends for his fault before, although the Prince had the aduantage of him. For where he was but hurt in the ſhoulder only, our <hi>Arragonian</hi> Knight was wounded, both in the Thigh, &amp; in his inward minde too: and yet neuertheles, he ſtood ſtoutly to his tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, grieued at the heart, that he could not rid his enemy out of the way, (in ſo long time) eſpeciallie fighting for his Ladie, and now (although too late) often wiſhing hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15406:160"/>a longer time, to recouer his former health. In the end, the blood ran ſo faſt downe from <hi>Don Iohns</hi> thigh, as euery one iudged he would be ouercome. For which all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie were maruellouſly ſorie. When vpon the ſudden (and contrarie to all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations) he began ſo furiouſly to follow the Prince, as with the often blowes which he doubled, and redoubled vpon him, hee made him kneele vpon the ground, where (when he had him at the aduantage, he loſt no time at all. For perceiuing that his enemie was in a manner aſtoniſht with the manie ſtrokes he had giuen him, without ſuffering him to haue any leiſure or time to breath, he aimed ſo rightly at his head, and that with ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a violence, as at one blow, he cleft it quite aſunder: the ſenceleſſe bodie falling downe vpon the ground, and quite bereft of ſoule, of pride, and of valour. At what time alſo, and with him (iuſt at that inſtant) fell <hi>Don Iohn</hi> himſelfe likewiſe, by reaſon he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully weakened through the loſſe of his blood, which iſſued forth from his wounds. Wherevpon euerie one ſuppoſed that hee was dead, as well as the other, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe imagining to be true, and (heauie aboue all the reſt) for the ſame: returned home vnto her Chamber, to bewaile his hard fortune, with her owne.</p>
               <p>To tell you what pittifull mone this poore Ladie made, and what bitter teares ſhee ſhead, being retired into her priuie Cloſet, would but moue you to greater remorſe. No comfort would ſhe receiue any way: neither would ſhe now reioyce, although ſhe had ſeen her enemie ſlaine, conſidering her valiant Knight had run the ſame courſe. She is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to liue after him any longer, ſince ſhe had bin the occaſion of his vndoing. Neither cared ſhee, although euery one had ſeene her thus to lament, becauſe ſhe hoped Death would ridde her from all ſuch doubts. Neuertheleſſe, her Gentlewomen much wondred thereat, maruelling what the cauſe ſhould be; moſt of them thinking it was for the death of the Prince of <hi>Lions,</hi> whom it was ſuppoſed ſhe ſhould haue married, and not for the blacke Knight, although they were all deceiued that thought ſo.</p>
               <p>Thus lay ſhee mourning vnto her ſelfe, neither would ſhee take ioy at any thing, vntill at the laſt, newes was brought vnto the Court, that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was found to bee that black Knight, that had bene her Champion, who was not (as it was before iudged) dead.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon ſhe began to giue ouer her lamenting, but yet in ſuch wiſe, and ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, as none of all her Attendants could perceiue it was for his ſake, that ſhee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on ſo before, although (God he knoweth) not anie in all the whole world was more ioyfull then ſhee, to heare of ſo comfortable tidings and newes.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, ſhee called for her Coach, and went vnto the Knight to viſite him, where, when ſhe was come, ſhe found a number of Ladies and Gentlewomen in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who were comforting of him, and reioycing with him, for his happie victorie.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was ſhee entred into the Chamber where he lay, but all the other giuing place, ſhe drew towards his beddes ſide: when he (poore ſoule) no ſooner had ſpied her, but that he forthwith ſounded: the companie imagining that it was his wounds, and not her ſight, that was the cauſe thereof: whilſt ſhe in the mean ſpace, was not a little amazed, to ſee him ſo mightily chaunged, and to looke ſo meger, pale, and hollow, whome not long before, ſhe had knowne to be the goodlieſt and propereſt man liuing.</p>
               <p>But this misfortune and ſicknes (hapned vnto him) ſhee laide no bodie in fault of, but her owneſelfe, confeſſing in her conſcience, that ſhe was the onely cauſe thereof: and therefore reſolued within her ſelfe, to make him amends with the loſſe of her owne life, if he ſhould hap to miſcarrie, or doe otherwiſe then well.</p>
               <p>And now my ſadde Maiſter being come vnto himſelfe againe, and ſeeing his Miſtris to looke ſo heauily vpon him, and ſighing, he held downe his countenance, not daring to behold her, whilſt the (Chyrurgians that had him in Cure, and others,) thought that it was the paine of his woundes, that made him ſo ill: And therefore, deſired eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to withdrawe themſelues from thence (for a while) that he might the better take his reſt.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, faire <hi>Maria</hi> was forced, (though ſore againſt her will) to leaue him: vowing vnto her ſelfe (if it ſhould pleaſe God, that her Knight might recouer his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health) to marrie with none but him: Thinking ſhee could not be anie mans (ſo rightly) as his, ſeeing he had (ſo brauely) reuenged her quarrell, vpon her hatefull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and had engaged his life, for her deare ſeruice.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:15406:161"/>
               <p>Alas, how ſhall I be able to make an ende of this pittious hiſtorie? I knowe not I, and therefore (good <hi>Arcas,</hi>) let this ſuffice, which I haue alreadie reported vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Heere the wretched <hi>Fortunio,</hi> powred forth whole fountaines of teares, it being a long time, before hee could ſpeake as much as one word more: but I preſſed him ſo much, and vrged him ſo often, that in the ende, hee went forward with his former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Ihon</hi> my Maiſter, had all the cunning Phyſitions and Chyrurgions that could be gotten, to looke vnto him, whereby hee might recouer his former health, and haue his wounds healed. But all was in vaine, for there was no Medicine or Balme, that could doe him any good, by reaſon of the great ſorrow, which hee had (before) conceiued in his minde: And becauſe the ſmall vertue and ſtrength of his radicall humour within him, which griefe had ouermuch weakened, was not of power ſufficient to nouriſh his grieuous wounds, and therefore they became both weaker and worſer, euerie day then other.</p>
               <p>They were not ouer mortall or deadlie, and yet (becauſe of diuers accidents) and what through the badde diſpoſition of his bodie, they became incurable: which they that looked vnto him perceiuing, and finding that there was no way but one with him, certified his friendes thereof; who tooke on moſt pittrouſlie, when they heard ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie newes.</p>
               <p>And now the laſt day was come, in which (moſt happily) hee muſt leaue this world, at what time (although as then too late) his Miſtriſſe ſhewed her ſelfe moſt kinde vnto him. For, ſhee hauing vnderſtood (by her truſtie Page, of whome I talked of before) that he was drawing towards his lateſt ende, determined with her ſelfe, not (long) to liue after him: wherevpon, ſhe tooke a fitte time, to ſteale ſecretly vnto his Chamber, where (being alone with him) and cauſing the doore to be boulted, ſhe came vnto his beddes head.</p>
               <p>But alas (Father) I am not able to proceed any further, for verie anguiſh of minde; my hart will burſt, if without weeping, I goe onward with my Tale. But yet I will doe what I can to make an ende thereof, although for euerie word I ſpeake, I ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſhead a teare.</p>
               <p>The kinde Knight, perceiuing the young Princeſſe to ſtand by him: whoſe eyes were turned into ſprings of teares, whoſe heart was turned into another <hi>Montgibell,</hi> with ſcalding ſighes: and whoſe amorous locks lay all rent and torne about her ſhoulders, with a hollow voyce, and throatling in his throate, ſpake thus vnto her.</p>
               <p>If it be (ſweete Miſtriſſe) for mee, your faithfull and wretched ſeruant, that you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo much, then I beſeech you giue ouer the ſame, and reſerue it for a better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and leſſen not the glorie which hee feeleth, for dying in your Royall ſeruice.</p>
               <p>But (alas) what is this I ſay? Is it likely that you can bewaile the loſſe of him, who, (when hee was liuing) you depriued of life, through your too extreame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour?</p>
               <p>No, no, I know it is not for mee that you thus take on: (for I confeſſe) I am not worthie thereof; but it is for the Prince of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who is ſlaine, that you torment your ſelfe, whome (perhaps) you made account of, to haue had for your husband. If ſo, then (cruell Lady) know this, that it was thy onely commaundement cauſed me to kill him: and had it not bene thy will, he had bene yet aliue. Neuertheleſſe, if in this I haue done amiſſe, I craue pardon of thee before I die, as well for that, as for anie errour elſe, that I haue moſt vnwillingly done againſt thee.</p>
               <p>I die (beautious virgin) yea I muſt die, onely becauſe I loue thee: accounting my ſelfe moſt vnfortunate, in that I haue not receiued one ſmall fauour at thy hands before my death. Neither am I willing to liue, ſeeing it is contrarie vnto thy will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>My dying lippes had neuer that bleſſed happe, to touch thoſe thy vermillion checkes: No, not ſo much as to kiſſe thoſe thy Princely handes; and all becauſe I was thereof vnworthie.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, if thou (moſt gratious Miſtris,) doeſt thinke that this my death, (for louing thee) deſerueth anie recompence, then I moſt humblie beſeech you, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15406:161"/>you pardon all that is paſt, graunting me to kiſſe, not your louely lips, but onely that your moſt victorious hand.</p>
               <p>O my ſoule, my ſoule, how inſupportable is your anguiſh, not to loue this my bodie, but to abandon the companie of my ſweet Princes: I die happily, being rid from all my griefe, and yet moſt miſerably, in that I loſe thee, whom I loue, farre more then my owne ſelfe.</p>
               <p>O faireſt creature of all, that euer were faire, remember, remember, thy deare <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> after he is dead and gone, who now taketh his laſt farewell of thee.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſo ſaid, he ſinketh downe into his bed, his faire Miſtris falling hard by his ſide in a ſound, but in the end, comming vnto her ſelfe againe, ſhe ſhed ſo many teares vpon the bloodleſſe viſage of the knight, as at length, life began to come in him once more, that he might yet a little longer enioy the preſence of her.</p>
               <p>O what a pittifull ſight was this to behold? Theſe two faithfull Louers, who neuer had receiued any ſolace, or comfort, the one of the other, in all the time of their life, now at the laſt (houre of their deaths) begin to embrace and kiſſe one another, ſucking that ſweet poyſon, which forced them to die, mingling their teares vpon their checkes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they drowne themſelues in the Seas of their owne laments and wailings.</p>
               <p>O happie Knight, to carrie with thee the ſoule of thy Miſtris, which with thy chaſte kiſſes, thou diddeſt ſucke from forth her bodie: and O bleſſed Princes, to haue receiued ſo faithfull a proofe of thy Loyall Louer, whileſt thou doeſt comfort him, he lying at the point of death.</p>
               <p>The one was whole, and without hurt, the other at deaths doore, and wounded mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and yet was ſhe that was whole, no more able to ſpeake, then the other that was ſo fore diſeaſed. Mute and dumb were both of them, they two hauing (as it were but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) (is but one will and minde was betwixt them) yet, this ſlight pleaſure which they drew with their ſole breath laſted not long, for ſo great was their inward griefes, as if they ſhould not haue ſpoken, their hearts muſt (then) needs burſt in ſunder.</p>
               <p>As the beautie of the Roſe that is gathered, ſoone vadeth away, becauſe it quickly withereth by reaſon of the heate of the Suune: Euen ſo, as ſuddely were thoſe ioyes which they conceiued, gon from them, whileſt the young Ladie weepeth, and weeping drieth vp the teares of ner faithfull Seruant, ſhe kiſſeth his cloſed eyes, and with her tongue wipeth away the drops, as they fall vpon his cheekes, but (alas) in ſteed of thoſe which ſhe drieth vp, his owne diſtilleth and lighteth vpon the ſame place, whileſt heauie ſighes make him to groane, and thouſand paſſions, interrupt and breake the paſſage of his ſpeech.</p>
               <p>He crieth out, and taketh on moſt bitterly, to ſee her thus to lament, he curſeth his hard fortune, and calleth her cruell, in that ſhe ſeemeth to enuie, at this his glorie, which he conceiueth in his minde to enioy by dying, and at the laſt forceth himſelfe to vſe theſe fewe ſpeeches vnto her.</p>
               <p>Alas ſweet Miſtris, what haue I done vnto you? what haue I done vnto you (I pray you) that you ſhould ſo much malice the ſmall remainder of this my hatefull life? Let me alone, I beſeech you, and ſuffer me to part out of this world quietly, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of me, now I am going away from hence.</p>
               <p>Are you not content that mine owne teares haue (ſo often) drowned me, but that I muſt needs be ouerwhelmed with yours alſo? O vnkinde and diſcourteous, euen vntill my lateſt end. If thou loueſt me (as thou wouldeſt make me beleeue) then ſhew ſome ſigne thereof, in appeaſing thy ſorrowes, for my loue ſake. Wilt thou make me ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as that (now I am dying) I ſhall finde my ſelfe to be the Author of all thy care and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Alacke doe not me that great wrong, and let it not be ſaid, that I haue receiued ſo vniuſt an iniurie from thee. Goe in peace, I pray you, and ſuffer me to die according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine owne wiſh.</p>
               <p>O wretched carkaſſe of mine, why diddeſt not thou breathe thy laſt, with the corpſe of thine enemie, when thou ſoughteſt the other day in the liſts, without procuring (as now) vnto thy ſelfe a worſe then double death? Well (Ladie) well, I ſee thou wilt not ceaſe from weeping, I ſee thou wilt ſtill be ſighing and ſobbing, and I plainely perceiue
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15406:162"/>thou wilt not giue ouer to lament for the loſſe of him, who is not worthy, that thou ſhouldeſt let fall one teare in his behalfe.</p>
               <p>Moſt gratious Princes, if my praiers cannot preuaile for me, and although thou wilt doe nothing in reſpect of me, ah yet at leaſt, haue ſome regard vnto thine owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: for what would ſtrangers thinke, if they ſhould finde, that thou thus takeſt on and mourne for me? Wilt thou make me ſo wretched, as to cauſe me to be thought to be the occaſion both of thy woe, and of thy diſcredit, which (although wrongfully) ſhall be a blemiſh vnto thy former renowme?</p>
               <p>Doe not, O doe not offer me, ſuch monſtrous iniurie, but rather (if thou thinkeſt that euer I haue done any thing that hath bene pleaſing vnto thee, or that I did fight againſt thine enemie in thy behalfe) recompence me, with this one good turne, which is, that thou bewaile not the loſſe of him, who whileſt he liued, was thy moſt religious <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> to the end none may reproach or defame thee (hereafter) in giuing out, that thou diddeſt Loue me.</p>
               <p>But I perceiue it will not be, I ſee my ſuite will not be graunted, wherefore O death, moſt kinde and courteous death, make haſt, come, come, and make haſt to rid me out of this too too ſeruile thraldome, to the end, I may no longer behold her thus to waile and weepe, who is my chiefeſt ioy and felicitie in this world.</p>
               <p>Then (once more) gratious Miſtris. But here, he was preuented by the wofull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who not being able to heare him thus to vexe and torment himſelfe, interrupted him (in his ſpeech) after this manner.</p>
               <p>Now by that rare vertue, by that admirable valour, and by that comelines of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, all which were lately thine, yea and by mine owne ſelfe, who will be none but thine, I entreate thee (my deare and faithfull Knight) and by that admirable loue which thou haſt heretofore borne me, and as yet doeſt beare vnto me, I coniure thee, to pardon me, for this thy death, for I onely haue forced thee to die: it is I haue bene thy vtter deſtruction, and I onely haue brought the (vntimely) vnto thy graue.</p>
               <p>Ah let me but heare that ſweete and comfortable word once pronounced by thee, before I diſcouer vnto thee, the ſecrets of my heart, and that I bewray any more of mine inward minde vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Louely Ladie (replied my Maiſter) I pardon thee with all my heart: but why doeſt thou thus ieſt at my hapleſſe miſeries, requeſting that of me, which I (firſt) did beg of thee, becauſe it belonged vnto me, and for that it is I, and not thou, that art (herein) culpable: neuertheleſſe, if thoſe words ſhall pleaſe thee, for whom I liued onely to ſerue and obey, and whom (now I am dying) I would be loth to offend, I am content to ſpeake them, ſaying; Faireſt and louelieſt Ladie, I moſt hartily pardon you.</p>
               <p>The meſtfull Ladie, hearing him to ſay ſo, began to drie her eyes, whileſt flinging the haire of her head vpon her ſhoulders, which before hindered her tongue from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſhe thus began to bewray her minde vnto him.</p>
               <p>I cannot denie (my deare heart) but that I was much too blame, when I firſt of all refuſed thy chaſte ſeruice offered vnto me: but alas, did I thinke, that for one onely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, thou wouldeſt haue giuen ouer thy enterpriſe, and betaken thy ſelfe to liue ſolitarily, as melancolicke perſon in a wildernes, and neuer more to moue me in this matter? God knoweth how often (afterward) I curſed my tongue, and wiſhed ill vnto my mouth for the ſame: for I will confeſſe the truth, that euen then, and before that time (as euer ſince I haue done) I loued thee moſt dearely.</p>
               <p>Full little did I thinke, but that I ſhould haue heard from thee againe ere long, when thou (preſently) diddeſt retire thy ſelfe from my preſence, ſo that although I knew thou louedſt me, and that I was willing to ſhew thee any honourable courteſie, yet could I not as faine I would, by reaſon I knew not how to ſend conueniently vnto thee, whileſt thou in the meane time, wert almoſt dead for griefe, and I little better, becauſe thou haddeſt forſaken me ſo ſuddenly. Now whileſt we both liued thus in great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, the Prince of <hi>Lyons</hi> (as ill fortune would) came hither vnto my fathers Court, and would needs force me to be his wife.</p>
               <p>But I, who had vowed in my minde, neuer to haue any other vnto my husband, then thine owne ſweet ſelfe, entreated thee, to trie the combat with him in my behalfe, not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15406:162"/>thinking that thou haddeſt bene halfe ſo weake, as I perceiued afterward thou wert.</p>
               <p>At the length it was thy good fortune to be victor of the field, whereof I was not a little glad; I determining with my ſelfe, whatſoeuer ſhould haue hapned, to haue bene married vnto thee. But woe is me, I now perceiue, death muſt cauſe vs to part in this world, although we will meete both together in another.</p>
               <p>And now ſeeing (at this verie inſtant) I am forced to behold thee, drawing thy lateſt breath, and that thine eyes are readie to be cloſed vp, with an euerlaſting ſleepe, thinkeſt thou that I either can or will, allay the heate of my griefes? or that I will reuoke my firſt word, which was to take part of ſuch fortune as ſhould be allotted vnto thee?</p>
               <p>Doeſt thou thinke I am ſo cruell, ſo hard harted, or ſo much voyd of remorſe and pittie, that thou dying before me, onely for my cauſe, and in my quarrell, I would not ſo much as lament, and bewaile thy death? Ah my vnkind friend, great wrong is this thou doeſt vnto me. No no, one and the ſelfeſame Tombe, ſhall encloſe both cur bodies together, and that which Loue would not permit to be thine whileſt thou liuedſt, gentle death ſhall put thee in poſſeſſion thereof, without any trouble at all.</p>
               <p>Thy commandement in this point, ſhall be of no force with me, thy prayers to no purpoſe, neither thy entreating of any power at all with me, but in any thing elſe, doe but bid me, and I will ſtrait obey thee: onely in this I muſt denie thee, for (aſſuredly I will die, rather then liue, to thinke that thou wert ouerthrowne through me, and that I ſhould liue continually to ſigh and cry out, ſaying; Alas, where is (now) my worthie Knight? Can mine eyes ſhine, and giue light, when thine are dead and gon? Can I endure to ſee thee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto thy graue, &amp; I not be buried in the earth? And can I abide to liue, to ſay, Behold yonder, my ſweet friends Tombe, and not be encloſed therein my ſelfe? Neuer demand ſo vniuſt a requeſt at my hands, neither be ſo hard harted vnto me, as to wiſh me to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue thee, to the end I may be the more miſerable.</p>
               <p>But perhaps, thou thinkeſt becauſe I haue bene cruell vnto thee, therefore thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt repay me with the like recompence againe.</p>
               <p>To which I thus anſwere. Firſt, the heauens know how much it was againſt my will, and haddeſt thou not bene too farewell and timerous, thou haddeſt ſaued both thine owne life and mine alſo.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I challenge the pardon which euen now, thou diddeſt graunt vnto me for this mine offence: and therefore (ſweet friend) be content and pleaſed; for with thee will I die, whileſt our coarſes ſhall lie one by another in one ſelfe Vault, which when they were liuing, was not permitted vnto vs; and for this I hope, mine honour cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion, ſeeing all ages haue allowed young Ladies, to loue honeſtie, braue and valiant Knights, and ſuch was my loue, and not otherwiſe, as God himſelfe can witnes. Who then can iuſtly taxe mine honour?</p>
               <p>(None my deare Knight) none, and ſeeing it is ſo; receiue this laſt kiſſe, from the moſt wofull woman liuing: receiue her heauie plaints, and her lamenting grones, and doe not oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt that ſmall remainder of contentment, which is behind for her, in dying with thee, which ſhe will take as a requitall, for ſo many miſeries which haue bene afflicted vpon her.</p>
               <p>Needes muſt I tell thee, that I doe enuie at that glorie thou haſt to die before me, but (long) ſhall it not be, for I will follow thee, as faſt as may be: meane while, and when thou ſhalt be in the heauens, remember I pray thee, thy deare and faithfull <hi>Maria.</hi> More would ſhe haue ſpoken, but that her heart was ſo ouerpreſſed with griefe, as ſhe fell downe dead vpon my dying Maiſter: who ſeeing ſo pittifull a ſpectacle, knew not what to doe, for helpe her any way, he could not, ſo extreame and faint he was.</p>
               <p>At the laſt, ſhe came vnto her ſelfe, when with a lowe and fumbling voice, he ſpake theſe fewe words (the laſt as euer he pronounced) vnto her. My gratious Ladie, now I beſeech thee, harbor no ſuch vnkinde conceit within thee, more good maieſt thou doe vnto me (with thy honourable ſpeeches) whileſt thou art liuing, then when thou ſhalt be dead, or if thou ſhouldeſt die with me.</p>
               <p>No ſweet Princes, no, liue, yea liue ſtill, and happily, ſeeing nothing fairer then thy ſelfe can liue. For elſe what diſcredit would it be vnto me, if it ſhould be obiected againſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15406:163"/>me, that I had darkned and extinguiſht the brighteſt Sonne of this world: let not ſo foule a blot ſtaine my memorie, after I ſhall be departed from hence aliue, &amp; ſeeke not to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thy time, before the will of God, cutting off thy ſelfe before he doth appoint thee, and diſpoſing of thy bodie, not according vnto his, but thine owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>An doe not ſo, for ſo you may not doe. Mortall creatures muſt be ruled by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ordinance aboue, and expect their leiſure, not doing any thing, but as they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them. Liue then (I ſay once more) and cloſe theſe my dying eyes, which whileſt they liued, were thine: this Boone, if thou ſhalt graunt me, I then ſhall thinke my ſelfe happie: but if not, then ſhall I account my ſelfe as moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>And now I feele that welcome death doth approach towards me, through which all my cares and troubles end. I my time is now come, my ſences faile, and my tongue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be ſpeechleſſe.</p>
               <p>No more haue I now to ſay to thee (my deare Princes) but onely to recommend my memorie and thine owne life, vnto thee, of which two things I deſire thee (as euer thou louedſt me) to haue an eſpeciall regard.</p>
               <p>Farewell, I can no longer ſpeake: farewell the beautie of this world: farewell the faire Sunne of my ſoule: farewell my ioy and onely comfort, and if euer thou thoughteſt me worthy of any fauour, embrace me once before I die.</p>
               <p>And thou ſweet <hi>Ieſu,</hi> mine onely Sauiour, haue mercie vpon me. Scarce were theſe words forth of his mouth, when the moſt diſconſolate Ladie, embracing her breathleſſe Knight, laied her mouth ſo cloſe vnto his, as his ſoule ſeemed to part out of his corpſe into hers, which with a ſweet (yet ſcalding ſigh) ſhe drew in her owne.</p>
               <p>And now, he being without life, and cold as any ſtone, the Princes knew not what to doe, faine would ſhe haue murthered her ſelfe, but that ſhe had no weapon wherewithall to doe the deed: beſides, ſhe durſt not ſtay alone in the chamber, leaſt ſhe might (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) be eſpied by one or other, and yet againe, ſhe was moſt loth of all, to leaue the coarſe of her kinde friend ſo ſoone.</p>
               <p>But in the end, reaſon tooke place, which perſwaded her, to conuey her ſelfe as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly from thence, as when ſhe came thither: which ſhe did ſo cunningly, through helpe of her old truſtie and aſſured Page, as ſhe was not perceiued by any, vntill ſuch time as ſhe recouered her owne lodging, where after ſhe had bene ſetled a while, ſhe loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the doore vnto her: and ſo, laying her ſelfe vpon her bed (after ſhe had for a certaine ſpace, wailed and lamented for the death of my Maiſter) ſhe held her breath ſo long within her bodie, and cloſed her mouth ſo hard, as (at the length) ſhe ſtifled her ſelfe for want of taking winde, and ſo was found dead, not any doubting of any ſuch matter, nor any knowing what the cauſe ſhould be of her death, but onely my ſelfe, and her foreſaid truſtie Page.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was ſhe found thus dead, and the bruite thereof noyſed abroad, but there was a generall lamentation and crying out throughout all the court: not vnlike that which was heard in <hi>Troy,</hi> the ſame night the Citie was ſet on fire (vpon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine) by the ſubtill <hi>Greekes.</hi>

               <p>It ſhall ſuffice, their Funerall obſequies were performed, and ſet out, in the moſt ſumptuous and coſtlieſt manner that could be deuiſed: which being paſt and done, I tooke my leaue of that countrie, minding to trie my fortune in ſome other place: and ſo taking with me ſome fewe Iewels, and certaine gold (which my late Maiſter had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon me) I went my waies, when (as I trauailed) on my iournie, ſome of the foreſaid Prince of <hi>Lions</hi> men (by ill fortune met with me) who knowing me to be a follower of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> that had ouerthrowne him in combat, laid violent hands vpon me, meaning to carrie me with them by ſea into their countrie, and there to put me vnto ſome cruell kinde of death.

               <p>If this thy glorious creature, ô immortall LORD, this (beautious Sonne) is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the people which are called <hi>Aatipodes:</hi> how much more worthilie then, art thou to be worſhipped of vs, who art the onely Father and Creator, both of this reſplendent, and all-ſeeing Lampe, and of all other things elſe whatſoeuer? If anie workemanſhip, may be accounted admirable in the eies of mortall wights, how much more then ſhall he be, that is the Architect, and framer of the ſame? And if a Table or Picture be found worthy of commendation amongſt men, how much more, and what greater praiſe doth the Painter himſelfe merit, that hath ſo liuely drawen it?</p>
               <p>Wonderfull are thou, (ô GOD) in thy workes? and nothing proceedeth from thee, but what is of that condition and number. Of nothing haſt thou made man, thou haſt formed Woman out of man, without woman: and men, of men and women; thou (thy ſelfe) being borne of a Virgin, without the helpe of man. Who therefore can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend theſe thine excellent effects? Thou ſufferedſt man to ſinne, to the ende, hee might be made more perfect; Afterward, thy ſelfe becomming man, as he is <hi>(ſin excepted)</hi> it being thy will, that ſinne ſhould come, the more to increaſe thy glorie, and to make manifeſt thy Mercie and Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Thou (ſometimes) haſt permitted euill, that a greater and a more wholſomer good, may ariſe of the ſame: not onely for their ſakes, who haue committed it, but alſo for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that were ſtrangers in the ſame.

               <p>To be briefe, wonderfull art thou, in all thy doings. Neither can anie comprehend thy diuine Actions, no more then thy firſt beeing and beginning can be knowne. For as wee finde and perceiue,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> the liuely heate of the fire, to come from forth the Stoue or Hot-houſe, and (yet) ſee no flame nor fire at all: So, although wee haue not beheld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer manie of thy ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cred works; yet haue wee found them to be moſt certaine and true, by reaſon of the fruites that haue come vnto vs through the ſame.</p>
               <p>Neuer hath any man viſiblie viewed the admirable coniunction of thy Deitie,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> with humanitie; and yet neuertheleſſe, wee ought to belieue it, becauſe of the profite that it hath brought vnto vs, which is, the Saluation and ſoules health of vs all.</p>
               <p>Then, if thy workes be ſo diuine, ſo religious, and ſo farre ſurpaſſing the naturall conceits of man: it is no maruell, although thou (after thine owne imitation and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) deſireſt, that that which man doeth, ſhould likewiſe be perfect, (hee being of thy making) to the end he may be found worthy of thy heauenly Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt charged thine Apoſtles (moſt ſtrictly) to be perfect, as thy Father, who liueth in heauen: and although they can neuer attaine vnto that good, ſo much deſired, yet (at the leaſt) thy will is, that they make an aſſay and proofe thereof, ſeeking (as much
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:15406:165"/>as in them lyeth) to doe vnto the vtmoſt of their power.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth this perfection (of which I ſpeake) conſiſt in any thing ſo much, as in thy works. For by the worke, the cunning and skill of the workman is found: as by the ſweetnes and daintineſſe of the verſe, the learning and deepe conceit of the Poet is knowne: And euen ſo, thoſe that will paſſe for maiſters, in any Art or Handicraft whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, giue teſtimonie of their skill, by ſome rare piece of worke deuiſed by them, which is accounted the excellencie of their cunning: whereby wee may perceiue, either their ſufficiencie, or their follie: their deepe knowledge, or groſſe errours therein. So that we find the perfection of eternall <hi>IEHOVAH,</hi> in nothing ſo much, as by his works, which are euery way right ſacred, and moſt excellent; Our Sauiour himſelfe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs, that wee ſhould not ſeeke to endeuour to approach vnto his perfectnes, in anie thing ſo much, as by doing ſuch excellent and heauenly deeds, as hee hath done before vs.</p>
               <p>The Prentice that endeuoreth to learne ſome exquiſite kinde of Trade, or Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of his cunning Maiſter, is he not properly ſaid to imitate him, as long as he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome piece of worke, that commeth nigh vnto that of his Maiſters? If ſo, why then, by this perfection, is vnderſtood as well (good works, as Faith.) For it is an eaſie matter to be brought to belieue. And had Chriſt meant (onely of Faith) by thoſe words, his doctrine (then) had bene ſuperfluous, and to ſmall purpoſe. For without Faith, his Diſciples (vnto whome he ſpake) could not haue bene his followers, becauſe euerie Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell is already damned: and they all abounded in Faith, ſeeing that through the ſame, they ſhewed ſo many rare miracles, but not ſuch good works, as the Sonne of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, which approched and drew neere vnto the perfection of ſuch, as his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father had done before.</p>
               <p>That great Apoſtle of his, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid he not afterwards vnto his Companions, <hi>Be yee my followers, as I am the follower of Ieſus Christ:</hi> and this hee meant, not alone by Faith, but as well, by good workes alſo. For that godly Diſciple did ſomewhat more then belieue, giuing teſtimony of millions of admirable good deeds, as when he raiſed ſome from death to life, healed other ſome of their infirmities, Preached, and wrote manie comfortable Epiſtles, and miniſtred reliefe vnto the poore, whome hee calleth Saintes. Yea, hee did more then this, for hee laboured with his owne hands, to get and purchaſe his owne liuing.</p>
               <p>If then we will imitate this man of God, we muſt doe as hee did, who was not onely contented to belieue, but alſo hath giuen vs great proofes, of many godlie workes, and worthy Actions, meriting no little glorie and praiſe.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>(Follower,)</hi> is properlie ſpoken of him that attempteth to doe what his Maiſter hath done before, as a young Scholler, that compoſeth an oration, after the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Cicero,</hi> (the father of eloquence) although he cannot frame it ſo exquiſitely, nor ſo eloquently, as his Author hath done, yet doth he ſtudie, to doe it as well as he can, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to come as nigh vnto his Phraſe, as poſſible he may.</p>
               <p>And ſo muſt wee doe, labouring, trauelling, and doing what good wee are able, to giue teſtimonies of our ſelues, that wee are followers of his Sonne, and of his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For, our Sauiour him ſelfe, liuing (heere) vppon the earth amongſt vs, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue onely, but did moſt religious workes alſo: ſo as, if wee will follow his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee muſt imitate him, not in his Faith alone, but as well in his good deeds, as the Apoſtles haue done before vs, who were dutifull and iuſt, doing (as their Maiſter did) thouſands of good deeds, vnto the reliefe and comfort, of the ſoules and bodies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a one.</p>
               <p>Faith then cannot be ſufficient for our ſaluation, without good works. For, were it good Iuſtice, that ſuch a one as had done millions of of cruelties, cutting the throtes of the godlie, and robbing, ſpoyling, and tytannizing, vpon the Common-wealth, both by ſword and fire, ſhould be ſaued, becauſe (as a Chriſtian) hee belieueth that there is a God?</p>
               <p>Why? ſo to doe, were to make God to be without Iuſtice; and ſo conſequently, to take it from him: For take away the properties of the ſubiect, &amp; you take away the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it ſelfe; diſmember a man, and you ſeuer his bodie from him: Euen ſo, depriue God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15406:166"/>Iuſtice, and you denie him to be GOD, for he can be no God without Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>That man, who (becauſe hee ſhall tearme himſelfe the neere ſeruant, and follower of his Prince) ſhall, vpon that ſecuritie, exerciſe manie maſſacres, notable murthers, and egregious villanies, ſhall not eſcape, but (for all that) be puniſhed by the Iudge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as we hope) we are to receiue good for doing good, and not if we doe what is bad and forbidden.</p>
               <p>Now, if the recompence for doing good deedes, and the puniſhment for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting euill Actions, are both taken away, to what ende (then) ſhould wee talke of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? and Iuſtice being caſhierde and baniſhed from hence (vpon which the veriy Lawe it ſelfe is founded) all Religion, and Faith, all humane ſocietie, and Commonwealths, muſt needs be ruinated, and quite ouerthrowne for euer.</p>
               <p>Should euery one be permitted to execute wickednes without daunger, to anſwere for the ſame; What then ſhould wee doe with Iuſtice? for then euerie one would giue himſelfe vnto euill and badneſſe, ſeeing it is more ſweet, and fuller of profite then goodneſſe: and the rather, becauſe that men are more prone by nature, to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the guerdon and reward of well dooing were taken away, who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any paine or labour, toyling and turmoyling his bodie, and ſweating day and night, when hee ſhall finde his trauaile to be without recompence; and that his merit ſhall be no more, nor better, then his, which hath done wickedly? But let vs rather ſay, that there is a reward for doing good, of the good: and a puniſhment for the vngodly, by ſuch as are wicked. For are there not Chriſtians that ſhalbe damned? No doubt there are.</p>
               <p>But wherefore are they ſo condemned? Is it becauſe they beleeue not rightly? or for that they had no Faith at all, neither for the one, nor for the other? For there is no Chriſtan, be he neuer ſo leaud or badde, but doth belieue, otherwiſe hee ſhould be tearmed a <hi>Turke,</hi> and not a Chriſtian: why then are they adiudged vnto ſuch an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſentence? Euen for their badde deeds and vngodly actions.</p>
               <p>For be they not the verie wordes of the Almightie, when hee ſhall ſit in his high Throne, at the laſt day in iudgement? <hi>Depart from mee, ye workers of iniquitie into Hell fire:</hi> and not, Away from me, yee faithleſſe wretches, who haue not beleeued aright.</p>
               <p>What ouerthrewe <hi>Lucifer?</hi> onely his badde deeds. Hee preſuming to dare to ſit, in the place of his Soueraigne, and not his default of Faith. For he could nor belieue ill, ſeeeing that he viſiblie ſaw, that which (Faith) commandeth vs to belieue.</p>
               <p>What droue our firſt father <hi>Adaw</hi> out of <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> what, but his badde dealings: for which he was chaſtiſed? What damned <hi>Iudas?</hi> euen that horrible and terrible wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, which he committed againſt his owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>That there is a recompence for liuing well, and a puniſhment for dooing ill: the <hi>Holie one,</hi> himſelfe inſtructeth vs, when hee vſed this ſpeech vnto <hi>Caine: If thou hast done iuſtly, ſhall thou not receiue thy reward? and if vngodlie, ſhall not ſinne then ſtand knocking at thy gate?</hi> Hee vſing heere this word <hi>(Reward)</hi> which cannot be, without deſeruing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For vppon what occaſion ſhould ſuch a one be remunerated with a rich reward, who hath done nothing worthie of anie recompence? And yet neuertheleſſe, ſeeing God doth promiſe a guerdon vnto him that doeth well: we muſt needs conclude, that good workes deſerues it, and that without them, faith is dead.</p>
               <p>The onely Sonne of the euerlaſting Father, vſed the ſame words, when ſpeaking of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies,</hi> (who made a ſhewe to doe good workes) he ſaid thus) <hi>Verilie, verilie, I ſay vnto you, theſe people haue receiued the reward of their works alreadie in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which we may conclude, that there is an other world to come, in which, theſe wicked <hi>Hypocritas</hi> had bene recompenced for their works: If, they had not had their due, whilſt they liued here vpon the earth. And hereby we learne, that there is a reward due vnto good workes, and that therefore, they are not vnprofitable (but (I ſay) not meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious) although there haue bene ſuch as haue denied this doctrine, becauſe they might liue without diſcipline, to haue the raine of liberty in their own hands, and not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto Iuſtice: to compaſſe which, they haue denied the commendations of good workes; to the ende, that euerie bodie might doe euill, without feare of puniſhment,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15406:166"/>ſeeing that doing well, ſhould be no more requited, then if they had committed euill.</p>
               <p>But ô yee helliſh ſpirited, what wicked vices, what Tyrannous crueltie, what open robberies, and what baſe villanies, haue your fond and beaſtly errours brought into this world? For (before theſe your groſſe opinions) were ſet abroach, no diſordinate leaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes raigned amongſt vs, all Murther, Robbing, Treaſon, Coſenage, &amp; deceit, being quite baniſht from vs: whereas (now) ſuch wicked minds, as you haue ſeduced, couet, rather to doe ill then well, becauſe they feared no puniſhment for the ſame, and that their good workes were not (as they thought) recompenced at all.</p>
               <p>But many Authorities ſhewe you to Lye, yea, and naturall Iuſtice it ſelfe, doth tell you that you are in the wrong.</p>
               <p>For wherefore did that Maiſter command his bad ſeruant to be puniſhed, who had not employed his Talent well, that was giuen vnto him at his departure: but that ſuch as are workers of iniquitie, ſhall one day be puniſhed? And that thoſe, who like other good ſeruants, haue taken grrat paines, and laboured well, ſhall be rewarded moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, as they were of their Maiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet teacheth vs the very ſame doctrine, when he aduiſed <hi>Nabuche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozer,</hi> not alone to belieue, (to the intent hee may be pardoned for his fault) but to ſhewe the fruites of good workes: as to giue Almes vnto the poore, and to doe manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deeds of Charitie, (which as the Apoſtle ſaith) is the moſt goodlieſt and holieſt of all the other vertues. For this ſhall neuer die, but alwayes remaine freſh and aliue: whereas Faith ſhall ceaſe, at what time we ſhall behold that great GOD, face to face, in whom we haue belieued; the hope whereof ſhall faile, when we enioy that diuine glorie, which wee expect and looke for. But diuine Charitie ſhall ſtill flouriſh, becauſe wee ſhall neuer giue ouer to remember (our acquaintance and friends, with whome wee haue liued heere vpon the earth, although we liue in heauen, praiſing God for them.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Although I were able (through Faith) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue Rockes, from one place into an other:</hi> yet, <hi>if I be without Charitie, I am like vnto on emptie Cimball, which can doe nothing but make a confuſed noyſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Small good then doth Faith without good works. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> did belieue, nor were they voyde of Faith: and yet behold, how they were plagued with death, by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe they had done a moſt wicked and diſſembling deed.</p>
               <p>For onely Charitie and not Faith, couereth the loathſomeneſſe, and the multitude of ſinnes, as a garment doth the priuie parts of man.</p>
               <p>And as that King at the Marriage, commaunded that fellow to be caſt into a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of darkneſſe, where was nothing, but wailing and gnaſhing of teeth, becauſe hee preſumed to come vnto the Feaſt, without his wedding garment.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, he that will not attire him ſelfe with the comely roabe of Charitie, ſhall be deliuered into the power of the Diuell, as one vnworthy to be admitted to come vnto the Banquet of Angells.</p>
               <p>Of ſmall force then is Faith, without Good works: which our Sauiour witneſſeth to be true, when hee attributeth the remiſſion of <hi>Marie Magdalens</hi> ſinnes, vnto the good worke which ſhe had done for him, ſhe hauing vſed ſuch Charitie vnto her Maiſter: and therefore he ſaid, <hi>Many ſinnes are forgiuen her, becauſe ſhe loued much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> are, as it were Twinnes, and but one bodie; for hee that loueth not, cannot be kinde vnto his aduerſarie: and therefore, the foreſaid <hi>Marie,</hi> by reaſon that ſhe had loued, and had ſhewed her ſelfe dutifull vnto our Sauiour, gained full forgiuenes of her ſinnes: of whoſe kindneſſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſpoken thereof (vnto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſaying; <hi>Wherefore are you angrie with this Woman? ſhee hath done a good worke for me, and therefore deſerueth well of mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſee then, by theſe examples, that thou (moſt gratious Lord) expecteſt good works to come from man, becauſe thine are ſo admirable: thou hauing taught vs, by the example of that Prince, that put to death thoſe wicked Labourers, in his Vineyard, how thou wilt recompence ſuch godly perſons, as haue done well, and wilt puniſh the wicked, whom thou ſhalt finde to haue done euill.</p>
               <p>Let vs then endeuour by our vertuous liuing, to be made partakers of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glorie, which followeth well dooing, the ſweetneſſe of which, the very <hi>Painims</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:15406:167"/>themſelues found, in former time.</p>
               <p>For, how famous is <hi>Hercules</hi> become in the world, onely for dooing well, and for putting in practiſe many notable and braue enterpriſes? Where if he had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, blacke ſhame, and perpetuall infamie, had for euer attended vpon him.</p>
               <p>Thus did the melancholike Shepheard diſcourſe vnto himſelfe, walking faire and ſoftly towards the Caue, whilſt as he went onwards on his way, hee might heare the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious harmonie of diuers ſortes of Birds, to welcome the riſing of the Sunne, which although they troubled him ſomewhat (conſidering his former deepe conceits) yet no doubt hee tooke delight at the ſame, if it be poſſible for wretched Louers to take anie pleaſure, when they are exiled from the preſence of their beaution? Ladies, as I feare me, they doe not.</p>
               <p>Beſides, hee might behold a number of louely Flowers, to ſhewe their vermillion faces, at the firſt appearance of this glorious Lampe, all which, were cauſes to comfort himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This iourney being no more weary vnto him, then it is vnto ſuch Trauellers, who when they walke abroad (deuiſe of ſuch things onely, as may inuite them to ſolace and ioy) whilſt he thought the heauens had changed their nature, willing to yeeld him ſome recteation and contentment, conſidering the great number of afflictions that hee had ſuffered before.</p>
               <p>But he was not long of this opinion, but that hee quickly chaunged his minde, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to be quite contrarie, aſſoone as <hi>LOVE</hi> awaked him out of this pleaſant dreame, and when he (once) bethought him of the abſence of his froward Miſtris.</p>
               <p>Hee that is troubled with a burning Feuer, hath manie daungerous fittes. One while, hee is vexed with a hote ſweate, and another while, with a colde. One day it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, and an other day it ſeazeth vpon him againe. So that ſtill the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, doeth dominiere ouer his bodie.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, this our wretched Swaine, falleth a freſh into the Sea of his ſorrowes, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhipwracke (oftentimes) in this <hi>Charibdis,</hi> of his deepe griefes, all which proceeded through the want of his <hi>Dianas</hi> companie.</p>
               <p>And had it not bene, but that hee had heard the ſound of a ſtraunge voyce, that droue away this ſadde thought from him, hee had bene farre more oppreſſed with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie paſſions then before.</p>
               <p>But hee, (with an attentiue eare) hearing this Song, (ſung not farre off from him) tooke a Truce for a while, with his dolefull wailings, and liſtened well vnto the ſame, as followeth.</p>

                  <hi>Arcas,</hi> preſently knew by the voice, that it was the meſtfull <hi>Orythia,</hi> and fearing leaſt her importunate praiers might make him to giue ouer his former determination, he left her, turning by another way vnto the Rocke.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, the Nymph perceiuing him to flie from her preſence, crieth out vpon him, exclaiming againſt his ſtubborne minde, &amp; calling him vngratefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Where we will leaue her (as now) curſing her hard fortune, and come againe vnto <hi>Arcas,</hi> (who being entered into the ſtonie Caue, and the old man (not as yet arriued there) began afreſh to muſe vpon the ſweet graces of his Miſtris, ſwimming with great delight in the Seas of her perfections, and not a little wondering how it were poſſible, that one creature alone ſhould be poſſeſſed of ſo many fauours as ſhe was, and yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he not well whether he dreameth or waketh, whileſt he ſtanding (thus) in a browne ſtudie, his tongue is ſilent, his eyes ſhut, his bodie moueleſſe, and his ſoule as it were in a traunce. Now if he was ſo much rauiſhed, in the onely contemptation of his Ladie, in what a taking had he bene then, if he had bene before the true preſence, and liuely face of her indeed, when the onely bare conceit thereof, had ſo great power ouer him? He deuiſeth within his heart of the beauties of her, and with a dumb pen, writeth them downe in the of role of his remembrance.</p>
               <p>One while he thinketh, he beholdeth thoſe faire, long, and flaxen haires, ſhe combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, with a fine combe of Iuorie, and curling them in knots, making the heauens themſelues to bluſh for very ſhame thereat, although they haue bene in ſteed of ſtrong cordes, wherewith his libertie was bound, yet had he not the power to hate them, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15406:168"/>(rather) honoured and adored them, imagining that <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe, neuer ware any ſo goodly, and that not any Goddeſſe whatſoeuer ſhe were, could haue the like, theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers being of this humour, that there is no other deities but their Ladies. Another while he is buſie, looking vpon her faire forhead (the right tipe of Maicſtie) perſwading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> (although he be Soueraigne ouer all the Gods) had neuer one ſo ſtately, whileſt he marketh how it is large, and without wrinkle, as being the enemie of all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, crueltie, and diſhonour.</p>
               <p>Then he admireth her eye-browes, thin, louely browne, and hating all care, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing verily that the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> had neuer any ſo prettie. Belike then, this Nymph had bereſt all the Gods, and Goddeſſes of their beſt beauties? No doubt in his conceit they had, ſo much did he doate on her Loue.</p>
               <p>This done, he commeth downe ſomewhat lower vnto her eyes, apprehending the brightnes of them, although they were farre off from him.</p>
               <p>As that Captaine that is ouercome, knoweth well the valour of him that did vanquiſh him, or as the Shepheard remembreth the lightning which flaſhed vpon his flocke as they fed in the Meadow, euen ſo did he ſuppoſe he (ſtill) felt newe darts, which ſhe whirled at him: for grieuous is the thought of ſad and heauie things, they being the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of all our diſaſters. Ah (ſaid he vnto himſelfe) how beautifull are her eyes? and yet not ſo beautifull, as piercing and terrible, reſembling thoſe of <hi>Circes,</hi> faire to ſee, and beautifull to behold, and yet, who looked vpon them, was changed from a man, into a beaſt.</p>
               <p>They are both faire and cruell, faire to view, ſhining as the Sunne doth in the ſpringtime, that driueth away all bitter weather: and cruell as the Baſiliske, whoſe onely ſight, killeth ſuch as doth but behold her.</p>
               <p>There is the lodge of Loue, with whom diſdaine and fiercenes ſoiourne, and there ſometimes doth pleaſure abide, but it is, when the other twaine be abroad, they hauing more intereſt in them, then ſhe hath. Hated they are, and yet loued, as the young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>O ſacred Loue, that take religious feare with him, for his companion: and O how iuſt and goodly a thing is Amitie, when it is married vnto awfull reſpect, although (farre from them) the flame is neuertheleſſe felt, as thoſe who ſtand behind the foremoſt at a fire, perceiue the heate thereof alſo, as well as they that ſtand before.</p>
               <p>So doth the traitor <hi>Ixion</hi> throwne downe with lightning into hell, feare and ſuſpect the flaſhy lightning of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hauing left her eyes, he commeth vnto her noſe, neither too big, nor too little, but comely, and of a moſt excellent proportion, in the making thereof.</p>
               <p>The eyes, nor noſe of <hi>Pallace,</hi> the Goddeſſe of battaile, are not more amiable, nor more angrie, although ſhe be fierce and couragious in martiall exploits. From thence he commeth vnto her lips, where he is drowned in a poole of ſweetnes, when he doth but thinke of the daintie colour, and the rare ſoftnes thereof, whileſt deſiring in his minde, but to touch them, through ioy and feare, he falleth into a ſownd.</p>
               <p>The more ſweet and ſoft he iudgeth them to be, the more he findeth his griefe to be bitter, becauſe he cannot touch them. A man careth not to enioy a matter of ſinall waight or valew, but to be hindered from the poſſeſſion of a rich treaſure, gaulleth him at the very heart.</p>
               <p>Neuer were the Cloue Gilliflowers in <hi>Iune,</hi> halfe ſo daintie, neither the Damaske Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſpring, a quarter ſo beautifull as theſe, yet were they ruddie like the Roſes, but farre more dangerous to be touched: for her pure honour, and her chaſte thoughts, were the pricking thornes, which would not permit any to approach nere vnto that peerleſſe muske tree. More ſoft and ſupple were they then the lips of <hi>Iuno,</hi> when <hi>Iupiter</hi> did kiſſe them, and more tender, and louely, then thoſe of baſhfull <hi>Europa,</hi> or bluſhing <hi>Alceſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he remembreth that goodly ranke of orient Pearle, empriſoned betweene two Rocks of right Currall, from which iſſued forth ſuch hunnie words, as rauiſhed his ſoule, not vnlike vnto <hi>Orphens,</hi> who forced ſenceleſſe creatures to follow him, with the ſound of his well tuned Harpe.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:15406:168"/>
               <p>Neuer did <hi>Mercurie</hi> talke more grauely or more eloquently then ſhe, although he was appointed to be Ambaſſador for the Gods: great was his griefe, when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe depriued from ſo happie a place, from whence (ſometimes) he had heard ſo many wiſe and admirable ſpeeches, to proceed from his Ladie, he being with the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof, ſo much enchanted, as his ſoule was not willing to returne backe into his bodie againe, not hauing power to leaue her, no more then the dumb ſtones and budding Trees were of force to retire from the entiſing Muſicke of the <hi>Thracian</hi> Poet.</p>
               <p>From thence he came, vnto her ſmiling and well formed cheeke, no Queene Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple drawne red, with the penſill of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> in the mouth of September, hauing ſo louely and naturall a colour. There was no need of cunning painting, nor deceitfull varniſh, to abuſe the eye, making the faces of women in time, farre more foule, then before: for what need hath ſubtill Art (when curteous nature hath done her part) to finde any deuiſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to better, what ſhe rather maketh worſe?</p>
               <p>The checke of <hi>Semele,</hi> neuer came neere in beautie, vnto her pure die: not vnlike that daintie morning, wherein the Sunne ſhineth in his pride; or like vnto a piece of faire white Alablaſter, mixed with a little vermillion red. Her necke was ſlender and thinne, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp with ſtate, like a curious ſmall Turret in a Princely pallace. Her dimpled chinne was prettie and round. But her beautious breſts exceeded all the reſt. There lay the mountaine ſnowe which could neuer be diſſolued with the heate of any Sunne. There was the priuie chamber and cloſet royall, of honour and chaſtitie. And there was that chriſtall Riuer of pure milke, where <hi>Cupid</hi> (being wearie of playing the wanton) vſed to bath and refreſh himſelfe very often. And there, the ſame God was wont to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, betwixt thoſe two beautifull Apples, they being farre more pretious, then that golden fruite of the <hi>Heſperides:</hi> yet were they hard as Diamonds, although the chiefe glorie of that race preſent.</p>
               <p>Her hands pleaſed him much, ſeeing them ſo faire, ſo long and ſo ſupple, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whereof, were excellent Muſitions, moſt diuinely playing vpon the ſiluer Lute, and well tuned Cytherne.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, neuer was there any creature ſo exquiſite and excellent in all points as ſhe was (in his conceit) he comparing her firſt vnto the three Goddeſſes, aſſembled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mount <hi>Ida:</hi> then vnto the Nymphs: and laſtly, vnto mortall women: accounting her to be farre more faire, then that great Lady ſo often rauiſhed: or more beautious then the Loue of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> or <hi>Marke Antonies</hi> ſweet Saint: yea, <hi>Flora</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> were but homely pieces vnto her, nor all ſuch gallant Laſſes, as flouriſhed heretofore, or ſhould come hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus was our Swaine rauiſhed, with the rare feature of his worthie Miſtris, and as the couetous wretch ſigheth, when he commeth to count in ſmall ſummes, the great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he hath bene ſpoiled of, euen ſo did <hi>Arcas</hi> take on and lament, when he began to dreame deeply of the greatnes of his vnſupportable loſſe.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, the Sunne began (openly) to appeare, waking men out of their drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſleepes, opening their eyes, and prying with his beames into their chambers, when the old manriſing, and comming into the Rocke, found our Shepheard ſo buſie (about muſing of his Miſtris) as he perceiued not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was entered, &amp; therfore he came neer vnto him, and ſaluted him, whileſt the other ſtood ſtone ſtill, like vnto a Rocke, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling that ſtatue of ſalt, into which the wife of Lot was turned; which the old Magitian perceiuing, he came and pulled him by the ſleeue, ſaying; How now (man) what cheare? where is your minde now? and why ſuffer you it ſo long, before it doe his ordinarie due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</p>
               <p>That dammage, which a ſenceleſſe creature doth (ouer whom his Maiſter hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) is laid vpon him, and not vpon the beaſt. We ought wiſely to rule, what is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs to gouerne: which if it be ſo, then why doeſt not thou looke vnto thy ſoule, but rather doeſt permit her to wander (thus) abroad, ſeeing that without her thou ſee-meſt as a dead creature? Call home for ſhame, call home (I ſay) thy wits together, and reſolue to ſubmit thy ſelfe vnto the iudgement of the Gods, and to doe as they ſhall command thee: for our griefes moue not them, neither doe our teares, appeaſe their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15406:169"/>rigour towards vs.</p>
               <p>Ah Father anſwered the Shepheard, how can he who hath no more power ouer his ſlaue (becauſe he hath paſt ouer his freedome vnto another) diſpoſe of him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, as he was wont? and how wilt thou that I beare ſway ouer my ſoule, hauing none within me, ſince I haue reſigned it vnto my Ladie, who diſpoſeth thereof, as ſhe beſt pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>And herein I reſemble that miſerable marchant, whoſe ſhip being driuen againſt a Rocke, ſcarce ſaueth his naked ſelfe, hauing before ſeene all his goods and ſeruants to be caſt away and drowned: or rather, I am like vnto that hapleſſe Duke of <hi>Ithaca,</hi> who hauing but one poore leaking veſſell, got a ſhore, through the helpe of the Sea Nymph.</p>
               <p>Can he whom the cruell Law hath ſubiected vnder the will of another (and being his poore drudge and ſlaue) doe as he faine would, and diſpoſe of himſelfe as he liſteth? You know he cannot: neither can I doe as I would, but as I may, for I am my Miſtris ſlaue, and although ſhe is not with me, yet my heart (which ſerueth in ſteed of a Table vnto Loue, to draw her beautifull conceit) preſenteth her euery minute before me, ſo as I ſeeme to ſee her liuely, the ſight whereof doth take away my ſences from me: for worthy things cauſeth vs to burne, in loue of them, and with a ſweet kinde of force, drawe vs (of our owne accord) to come vnto them.</p>
               <p>Then maruaile no more, though thou findeſt me thus out of temper. If meere griefe, be of power to procure death, then what may Loue doe, which not onely ſeazeth vpon the bodie, but likewiſe vpon the ſoule? ſcarce had I wet the ſoales of my feete, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into this wide Ocean of ſundrie conceits, when thou withdreweſt me from the ſame, as that carefull father doth his harmeleſſe child from the brim of ſome pit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might fall, and be drowned. But alas, what wouldeſt thou haue me to doe? Suffer me I pray thee, and let me alone in my muſing, for there is nothing more pleaſant vnto a wofull man, then to dreame of ſuch delights as he hath once taſted, becauſe (as then) he thinketh ſtill to taſt them. I was dreaming of that contentment which the companie of my <hi>Diana</hi> hath heretofore brought me, why then haſt thou diſturbed me in the ſame? when perhaps I ſhall not encounter with ſo ſweet a thought I know not when againe, and the rather, for that a leuen houres and three quarters of a day, are deſtined for the miſhap of man, and onely one poore quarter appointed for his contentment: of which ſmall ſpace of time, many haue bene depriued, in the number of which I am the chiefe.</p>
               <p>No no, replied the old man. Not to thinke of misfortunes, maketh a man as happie as if he had neuer bene afflicted with any: for he cannot be ſaid to be ſicke, that liueth without any feeling of griefe or diſeaſe: ſo he is not wretched, that neuer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth his former diſaſters, the thought whereof is the occaſion that maketh vs ſo ſad. Driue then theſe idle fancies out of thy braine.</p>
               <p>Hardly could courteous <hi>Dido</hi> entreate the wandring Prince of <hi>Troy,</hi> to repeate and report the ouerthrow of his countrie, although he was much beholding vnto her, for irkeſome is the calling to minde of ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Away then with theſe toyes, and begin thy diſcourſe, where thou laſt didſt leaue, which will like thee better, and the rather, when thou ſhalt account thy happie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>Ah good father (anſwered <hi>Arcas</hi>) neuer hath my tongue bene vſed to talke of any good fortune, that hath hapned vnto me heretofore (for few or none haue I had) but onely to ſigh forth my ſtrange and wofull loſſes.</p>
               <p>What Sunne haue theſe my drerie eyes euer beheld, without new floods of teares? and what darkeſome night hath couered them with neuer ſo heauie a ſleepe, but that freſh griefes haue growne before the breake of day within my ſoule? My wofull pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in this vnconſtant world, hath alwaies bene vnluckie, diſmall and vnfortunate, and therefore I would to God, that death had abridged the ſame.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould you thinke that I could liue (and languiſh thus) without bethinking me of my loſſe? Nothing pincheth the heart more, then a mans ouerthrow, becauſe it is long before he can recouer himſelfe againe, and for that it will aske much labour and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:15406:169"/>paine: yea, it is ſo deeply inprinted within vs, that although we haue in time repaired and amended our ſelues, yet ſtill there remaineth ſome one marke or another, that galleth vs, euen at the very quicke.</p>
               <p>Who euer ſawe man (hauing endured great hinderance and miſhaps) but that he ſometimes thinketh thereon, yea and now and then bewaileth the ſame, although he haue neuer ſo great a courage? We are (all) good regiſters of ſuch aduerſities as happen vnto vs, but not of proſperitie: and ſooner can we call to minde an iniurie done vnto vs, then remember a benefit or good turne, which we haue receiued: for this old ſinne of our great grandlire <hi>Adam,</hi> draweth vs alwaies, rather vnto bad, then good.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon, that men for the moſt part are naturally giuen ſooner to ſlaunder, then to defend the good name and credit of their neighbous: and ſo likewiſe this is the cauſe, I ſo liuely feele and apprehend the remembrance of my calamities, not wiſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſo much, as to be confined within ſome Rocke alone like a Recluſe; to the end, I might the better meditate vpon them, and the more bitterly bewaile them.</p>
               <p>Now (quoth the old gray-beard) I ſee thou art in the wrong, for we muſt not haue our eyes alwaies vpon the earth, but ſometimes we muſt as well looke vp towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſerueth this diuine reaſon, which maketh vs Lords ouer all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if by her aide we repulſe not ſuch mortall paſſions, as come into the world with vs? And to what end doth a father ſend his Sonne vnto the Vniuerſitie, moſt willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraving his charges, if he ſhould not learne and enrich himſelfe in knowledge? Euen ſo, why ſhould we be counted reaſonable? and wherfore hath our God done ſo much for vs, If we cannot through the aide and helpe of reaſon, wade through the depth of theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane miſeries?</p>
               <p>To what purpoſe hath a Generall of an Armie Royall, hundreds of Captaines, and thouſands of Souldiours, if he doth not employ them in the warres, but rather permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the enemie to ouerthrow them? As victualls, are ſet vpon the Table, whereon to feede, ſo is reaſon beſtowed vpon vs, to vanquiſh our naturall paſſions, and moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt croſſes.</p>
               <p>Neither can any iuſtly excuſe themſelues, when they ſhall confeſſe to haue bene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, through theſe mortall impediments, ſeeing they were armed with weapons to reſiſt them, which are diſcretion and reaſon. The bruite beaſtes, that haue loſt their little ones (although they haue no wiſedome) take not on more, neither ſhewe more tokens of follie and rage, then that man doth, who ſuffereth himſelfe to be carried away with griefe, and yet in the meant time he is called their Lord and Maiſter, becauſe of reaſon onely: but he is much vnworthie of this Soueraigntie, if he knoweth no better how to exerciſe his royall dignitie then they: as he is vnmeete and vnfit to haue the name of a King, who as a Tyrant doth moſt vniuſtly violate the Lawes of the Realme, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Iuſtice, and all good orders, belonging vnto the ſame. Either thou muſt be a man or a beaſt, if thou art a man, then carrie thy ſelfe like a man, rightly employing reaſon, which maketh thee one.</p>
               <p>If thou be a beaſt, neuer then ſteale away this qualitie belonging vnto man, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy ſelfe with that which is fit for a beaſt, and ſo ſhall thy fault be the leſſe. For we wonder not ſo much at an offence done by a beaſt, neither condemne him vnto death for the ſame, becauſe (as a beaſt) we know him to be without reaſon. But man we puniſh ſeuerely, for that he (being a man) ought not to commit any ſuch hainous crime, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gouerning himſelfe by reaſon, ſeeke to ſhun and auoid the danger thereof.</p>
               <p>We cannot deeme the opinion of an ignorant perſon, and one without knowledge, to be cruell or bad, eſpecially when he iudgeth according vnto his ſmall skill: but wicked and vniuſt, may we tearme the ſentence of a wiſe and learned Iudge, if he ſhall giue his cenſure, contrarie to all reaſon and Lawe.</p>
               <p>Shew then thy ſelfe to be a man, and a right man indeed, chuſing Reaſon for thy guide, by which meanes thou ſhalt tame thy ſenceleſſe deſires, and keepe vnder theſe more then extreame paſſions.</p>
               <p>Good, and of great force (reuerend ſire) replied the Shepheard, were your perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if you ſpake vnto a free man, who becauſe he is not bound vnto another, might
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15406:170"/>eaſily through the helpe of reaſon vanquiſh his naturall imperfections.</p>
               <p>But although the ſlaue, may perhaps doe a thing worthie of commendation, yet, thinke you he dareth attempt it, without the good will of his Maiſter? Euen ſo, although Louers were fit to bring to paſſe, as much as you ſpeake of, and to maiſter their mortall paſſions, through reaſon, yet are they ſo ſhroadly bound and tied vnto this hard Lawe, as they are not able to doe any commendable or good thing, vnleſſe it pleaſe Loue, who forceth them to be ſlaues vnto their Ladies.</p>
               <p>The Beare, by nature is wild and ſtrong, yet, when he is taken, bound, &amp; made tame by a man, what great proofes of his ſtrength can he ſhew? Euen ſo I will not denie, but man is wiſe, and furniſht with reaſon, and yet I ſay he cannot aide nor helpe himſelfe, as long as he ſhall be ſubiect vnto <hi>Cupids</hi> Lawes.</p>
               <p>A King, that is a priſoner, is for all that a King ſtill, his Realme is, where it was before, and ſo is his Crowne and Scepter, and yet notwithſtanding all this, during his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he can doe no act of a King, neither make proofe of his regall authoritie, becauſe he is depriued of his libertie.</p>
               <p>So fareth it with men that are in loue, they (ſtill) are men, and yet neuertheleſſe, they cannot doe the office of men, becauſe they are Bond-men, and ſubiect vnto the will of an other. Beſides, if naturall maladies, which as thou ſaieſt are ſubiect vnto the reaſon of man, oppreſſe and ouercome him many times, cauſing him to fall mad and franticke; how much more eaſily may Loue enforce the ſame, who not onely, is greater then theſe humane accidents, but alſo then the Gods themſelues?</p>
               <p>Wonder not then, although you ſee many Louers without wit or diſcretion; for of two poyſons, the leſſe feeble, muſt yeeld vnto the ſtronger: and where two contrarie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies he, the field muſt needs remaine vnto him that is of moſt force: ſo where two ſuch great powers as Loue and Reaſon meete together, the weaker, muſt needs yeeld vnto the other which is Loue, that maketh many Louers liue with ſmall or no reaſon at all.</p>
               <p>To argue or diſpute, that Loue is of leſſe force then Reaſon, were but a groſe error, (for the wiſeſt next vnto the Gods) haue not onely with reaſon confuted this abſurditie, but by experience it ſelfe, haue tried as much, in their owne proper perſons.</p>
               <p>Let vs then excuſe Louers in their vnreaſonable actions, which appertaine onely vnto men, as <hi>Iupiter</hi> winketh at them, for breaking their Othes: and blame me no more, if I (as a wretched caitife and ſlaue) am forced (maugre my ſelfe) to giue ouer that, that is moſt excellent and rare in man, to follow the will of my Maiſter, at whoſe command I am.</p>
               <p>Well then (ſaid the Magitian) I will vrge thee no more, for it is but reaſon that he that is in health, yeeld gently vnto the diſeaſed in his conceit, and that the fortunate, iump in opinion with ſuch as are miſerable, making ſhew to know of nothing, but what the other is willing; becauſe they are alreadie but too much afflicted with their misfortunes, without galling them afreſh, croſſing them in their ſpeeches, and wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of them that, which they are loth to bewray vnto the world.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore giue ouer this diſputation, yet with this concluſion, that nothing can exceed the right wiſe man, &amp; that no faults are to be excuſed (through what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſoeuer they ſhall proceed) in him, who will be counted reaſonable and wiſe, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſomewhat vnto Loue, in thy fauour: and therefore proſecute thine old Hiſtorie, comforting thy minde with the remembrance of ſuch matters, as ſhall be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pleaſing vnto thee. Content anſwered the Shepheard, if there be no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, and thereupon after he had a while pawſed, he thus began.</p>
               <p>What can be more gratious, vnto a condemned perſon, then to heare of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? and what obligation is more deare vnto a man, then that which doth cancell his debts?</p>
               <p>Cruell and barbarous, vngodly and wicked were <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> accounted, in that they ſlew <hi>Caeſar</hi> (although they ſhadowed their fault vnder the colour of doing their common wealth good) becauſe they had receiued their owne liues of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who might (if he ſo had pleaſed) haue put them both to death.</p>
               <p>So ſweet was the pardon my Ladie gaue me, which quite changed my minde, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15406:170"/>mee to life, and draue away all deſire of death from me.</p>
               <p>Straunge and extraordinarie are the meanes, by which the Heauens lend ayde and aſſiſtance vnto miſerable men, eſpecially, when they leaſt expect any ſuch ſuccour to be at hand. Thouſands of daungers did conſtant <hi>Marius</hi> eſcape, and in the ende, came to be chiefe Ruler in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heauens are ſo curteous, as hardlie will they ſuffer, that anie man be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne or vndone, and fewe haue there bene, that haue offered to lay violent handes vpon themſelues, which they haue not ſaued.</p>
               <p>Being as then both iocund and merrie, I feaſted, and made much of poore <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunio,</hi> within my little Cabbin, who vppon a day, ſitting at the Table with mee, began thus to talke.</p>
               <p>Certainely, I will neuer maruell more, to ſee thy face portrayed forth with griefe, ſeeing thou loueſt ſo faire a Ladie. For farre more daungerous and difficult is his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile who aduentureth beyond the Seas, to finde ſuch curious marchandizes as be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rare, then the paines an other taketh, who is contented with ſuch things as his owne Countrey affordeth.</p>
               <p>No more can thy enterpriſe be other then heauie and full of perill, thou louing no ordinarie Beautie, but ſuch a one as is moſt peerleſſe and admirable. And therefore is thy minde more haughtier then other Louers, who followe faces leſſe faire then thine by oddes.</p>
               <p>But yet let this be thy comfort, that the more thou doeſt hazard thy ſelfe in this ſo dangerous an Attempt, the more glorious ſhall the victorie be, when thou ſhalt obtaine the ſame. For not matters of ſmall importance, but ſuch as be hard and vnlikely to be atchieued, deſerue honour. Vertue oftentimes making her ſelfe knowne amongſt foule Vices, as the Sunne doth in middeſt of the ſtarres.</p>
               <p>But I pray thee tell mee, who ſet thee in hand with this ſecond Taske: and what gentle God heated thee with this other flame? ſeeing thou ſo long time, didſt vowe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto the diuine <hi>Iulietta;</hi> who when ſhee ſhall know hereof, will condemne thee for chaunging, and account thee as one fickle and vnconſtant.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Fortunio,</hi> (replyed I) none can iuſtlie conceiue ſuch finiſter opinion of mee. For doeſt not thou knowe, that my Loues were neuer other then honeſt and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable?</p>
               <p>I neuer loued the Bodie of anie woman, ſo much as I did her ſoule. It was the beautie of the minde, and not the perfection of her perſonage that I eſteemed, and therefore doeſt not thou (call to membrie) that onely ſighes, haue bene the fruites of my loues?</p>
               <p>He cannot be tearmed a Thiefe or Robber, that liketh and ſeeketh for all ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as Vertue maketh amiable, in anie ſubiect, where they are found.</p>
               <p>Neither will the wiſe be angrie, or offended at all, that their equalls are accounted of, and that their perfections are honoured and blazed abroade, as well as their owne bee.</p>
               <p>Long ſince, the auncient Sages of <hi>Sparta,</hi> neuer fell out amongſt themſelues, nor were iealous, the one of the other, if many of them had caſt their affection vpon one goodly childe or other: becauſe, they all ſtriuing to exceede one an other in good will, endeuoured within themſelues, to bring vp the ſame youth, to be as perfect as might bee.</p>
               <p>How then, can my famous <hi>Iulietta</hi> condemne mee, (or once thinke ill of mee?) if I (hauing heeretofore exalted, carrolized, and blazoned abroad, her rare Thewes,) doe now take Truce with my Penne, to the ende I might the more caſilie beſtowe a little time, in diſplaying, (by my writings) the excellent gifts of an other Ladie, who doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with her Vertues?</p>
               <p>The loue that a kinde Father beareth vnto one of his Children, doth not hinder him, but that hee may make much of the reſt. And the white colour that one eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of, (in his owne conceit) is no ſuch let, but that hee may (as well) like, what is ſable and blacke.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:15406:171"/>
               <p>This word <hi>Vnconſtant,</hi> or <hi>Wanering,</hi> is meant by ſuch ſenſuall and voluptuous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as ſeeke and hunt after pleaſure onely, (delighting alſo in chaunge) and neuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account of Vertue, as I doe.</p>
               <p>For of what Inconſtancie can the faire and learned <hi>Iulietta</hi> taxe me, if (without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing broken my word vnto her) I honour her, as much as euer I did before? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, cruell ſhould that honour be vnto mee, and hardly ſhould ſhee deale with mee, if ſhe ſhould forbid me to reuerence and eſteeme of an other Ladie, who deſerueth the ſame dutious reſpect as ſhee doeth: As a iealous Husband is cruell and vnkinde vnto his chaſte wife, if he ſhall prohibite and hinder her, to loue ſuch qualities as are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and praiſe-worthie.</p>
               <p>Honeſt Affection is not like vnto fooliſh Loue, for the one beareth and endureth many things with patience, it being poſſible for one man to loue manie vertuous ſparits, without reproach, and all at one time: where the fooliſh Louer cannot loue ante more, then one fond woman at once: except hee be counted a Cozoner and forſworne. He cannot be iudged to be wiſe and of diſcretion, who (for his owne reſpect) will ſeeke to hinder in what hee may, that ſuch things as are vertuous and commendable, ſhould not be liked, nor accounted of.</p>
               <p>But ſuch a one is not of himſelfe, worthie of anie (Loue) at all: For to oppoſe ones ſelfe againſt the honour which is giuen vnto Vertue, is to be her mortall enemiet Vertue being worthie to be reuerenced and priſed, in what manner ſoeuer ſhe is found, as a rich Ring, is to be accounted of, vpon what finger ſoeuer it is put.</p>
               <p>Poore was <hi>Homer,</hi> and yet his Learning brought him to be reſpected, hee hauing had (beſtowed vpon him) thouſands of Honors, worthie of eternall glorie, yet if hee ſhould haue ſought to haue ſwallowed vp all theſe great Fauours done vnto him, and haue ſtudied by all the meanes hee could to croſſe others that deſerued well, ſeeking to keepe them backe from ſuch dignities, as were awarded vnto them: hee not onely ſhould haue bene counted both groſſe and ignorant, but alſo ſpitefull, malicious, and ill giuen.</p>
               <p>And ſo would the world repute of the matchleſſe <hi>Iulietta,</hi> if ſhee ſhould ſtomacke and take in ill part, that her equalls ſhould haue ſuch praiſe, as they but worthilie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. For although now I loue <hi>Diana,</hi> yet doe I not (anie way) giue ouer to like <hi>Iulietta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Schoole-maiſter ſometimes giueth ouer teaching, graunting leaue vnto his Scholler to goe play: not ſuffering him alwayes to ſtand poaring vpon his booke: Euen ſo, I moſt humble muſt intreat her, to permit mee for a while, to ſound forth the praiſes of <hi>Diana</hi> abroad, as I haue (alreadie) done hers.</p>
               <p>But now repoſe thy ſelfe <hi>Fortunio,</hi> and take thy quiet reſt, for I perceiue thou art as yet wearie of thy great trauaile and labour, and we will hereafter finde a more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient leiſure, to talke of theſe our olde matters.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, the poore ſoule tooke mee at my word, and beeing (very willing to ſleepe indeed,) preſentlie went and layde him downe vpon a bedde, where hee reſted ſoundly.</p>

               <p>Theſe Verſes I kept, to preſent them vnto my <hi>Diana,</hi> hoping to find her in the ſame good minde, as I left her, and to gaine ſome one ſmall fauour or other for my reward of her. But things that are framed ſlightly, are of little or no account of all: &amp; warre it ſelfe, hath not ſo manie deuiſes and ſundrie effects, but <hi>LOVE</hi> hath farre manie more.</p>
               <p>And yet no maruell, for hee being a tender and delicate childe, cannot chuſe, but by nature muſt needs be mutable and vnconſtant: And therefore it is no ſmall misfortune vnto men, that are forced to obey, not a graue, and well experimented Maiſter.</p>
               <p>But this peeuiſh Boy, from whom want of yeares, taketh away all knowledge of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which as wee growe in bodie, ſo doeth it ſprout forth in vs; For wretched is that Realme, that is gouerned by a Childe: becauſe verie hardly without ſtumbling, can a blinde man leade another, without a light.</p>
               <p>Now I being merrie at the hart, and as iocund as might bee, went to ſee if I could finde out my Miſtriſſe, when thinking to haue no reaſon, nor occaſion at all to feare, I then found her quite contrarie vnto my hopefull expectation.</p>
               <p>As Mowers are wonderfullie amazed, when as (the Sunne ſhining faire and cleare) they ſee vppon the ſuddaine, great ſhowres of raine to ſtreame downe, with manie hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible flaſhings of Lightning and Thunder, (and much like vnto a bluſtering Tempeſt) a terrible Whirle-winde, breaking forth of the priſons of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> carrying away their

               <p>Neuer went any thing more nearer vnto my heart then this did, I beeing ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therwithall, as I was almoſt at the point of death. For hauing ſought out my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whome: I expected ſhould be as curteous and debonaire, as I had left her the day before, I found her quite and cleane altered from her former diſpoſition; ſhe looking vppon me with a moſt fierce and diſdainefull countenance, not vouchſafing ſo much as to ſpeake one milde word vnto me, or to accept of my Verſes, which I (in humble wiſe did offer vnto her.</p>
               <p>Alas (thought I) what meaneth this? and how contrarie are the proceedings of <hi>LOVE,</hi> vnto all other things? For they chaunge alwayes, and this their ſuddaine alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, altereth ſtill againſt the hope of Louers.</p>
               <p>Other men ſeeing their buſineſſe to fall out well, looke for ſome happie iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But in Loue, when our matters are prettilie well, and likely to prooue beſt, then are wee driuen moſt of all to feare; and when they are paſt all hope, then haue wee the chiefeſt cauſe to expect the beſt.</p>
               <p>If this encounter was not farre more bitter and vnfortunate, then the meeting of a Thiefe is vnto the way-faring man, iudge you (good Father,) for it is too grieuous a Corſiue vnto the innocent perſon, to be condemned vnto death, and yet not ſo much as once to heare nor vnderſtand his iuſt defences in the ſame. But in the meane time, I muſt perforce ſwallow downe this vnwelcome Potion.</p>
               <p>As the Slaue that is runne away, beeing taken and brought backe againe vnto his Lord, trembleth and feareth ſore, being forced to endure what puniſhment ſoeuer, ſhall be inflicted vpon him.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, there was no other remedie, but that I muſt needs abide the diſpleaſure of my Miſters, and take patiently, what it ſhould pleaſe her for to impoſe vpon mee. I know not whether any olde conceit comming afreſh into her minde, had chaunged her former humour, or whether ſome other new opinion (conceiued without reaſon,) had made her ſo outragious or diſdainefull towards mee. But whatſoeuer it was, neuer did I ſee her to looke ſo angerlie vpon me before.</p>
               <p>As the Maiſter of a Shippe is paſſing ſadde and heauie, who hauing gotten verie nigh vnto the Hauen, and beginning to caſt Anker, perceiueth himſelfe to be carried backe againe into the maine Sea, by a ſuddaine ſtorme, his Shippe being ready to runne vpon euery Rocke, and ſo to ſinke and drowne.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo it was my lucke to periſh euen in the Hauens mouth, and beeing eſcaped of a ſicknes, then to die vpon the ſudden.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee how iuſt my complaints were. For more cruell are thoſe dartes which vnlooked for pierce vs, then thoſe that wee knowe of: and more ſharpe is the paine, that commeth vpon the ſuddaine, then when we did (before) expect it.</p>
               <p>Being then fallen into this ſuddaine miſchaunce, I knewe not what order to take, nor what reſolution to reſolue vpon, but only ſuch as deſperate wretches vſe, which was to make away my ſelfe, and to haue recourſe vnto the ſelfe-ſame death, which I had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore choſen, whereby I might rid me of my torments.</p>
               <p>And now I was entring into that great and beaten path of deſperate caytifs, hoping by this means to bring an end to all my troubles: which dangerous courſe I had quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, had not the curreous heauens, bene more pittifull vnto mee, then I was vnto my ſelfe, making vaine and fruſtrate my former intention and meaning.</p>
               <p>O how hard is it (ſometimes) for a man to die, and ſometimes againe, how eaſilie may he diſpatch himſelfe?</p>
               <p>The wiſe man ſaith, that mans life is as brittle as glaſſe, that is, quickly broken: and yet notwithſtanding, many liue longer then they would, wiſhing to die, although they cannot. For ſuch as goe merrilie vnto their deaths, becauſe they hope their miſeries ſhall end with their liues, lament not at all for the loſſe thereof, but rather thinke, they haue a happie turne. As the ſicke Patient that couragiouſly ſwalloweth downe his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15406:172"/>Pills, which if hee were well and in health, were neuer able to doe it.</p>
               <p>Being throughly reſolute what to doe, I now gaue ouer weeping and ſighing, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I accuſed my Deſtinies; making mee one while fortunate, and then againe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whilſt in the meane ſpace, I did a little complaine of my Miſtriſſe, but yet with ſuch reſpect, and in ſuch a reuerend manner, as ſhe could take no exceptions againſt me at all.</p>
               <p>This done, I went to die for her, and yet durſt I not terme her to be the occaſion of my death: Not vnlike vnto theſe holie and deuout perſons, (who although they be plagued with all ſortes of miſeries,) neither dare, nor will venture to call the Gods the Authours of their wretchednes.</p>
               <p>Me thought I was but too fortnnate, to die for ſo worthie a ſubiect, and that I was ouer-bountifully recompenced (for all my troubles) to haue that glory, as to haue ſeene my cruell Saint, for whom I dyed.</p>
               <p>O faithfull and loyall <hi>LOVE,</hi> that will not permit (what paines ſoeuer I endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) that I ſhould not complaine of mine enemie.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Pyramus</hi> dying for his <hi>Thisbes</hi> ſake, thought not himſelfe vnfortunate: neither accuſed her for his death. And ſo was I as willing to followe the ſame courſe, as that braue Caualier of <hi>Rome</hi> was, who boldly leaped into the ſwallowing Gulfe: or like his Countrey-man, that with as great courage thruſt his fiſt into the fire.</p>
               <p>A matter that is alreadie well determined of, (be it neuer ſo hard,) is halfe diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at the firſt: And there is nothing that looſeth more time, then vncertaine reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>I had now got vp, vpon the toppe of the ſame Rocke (where I was before,) min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to finiſh my loathed life, and was readie with a braue manly heart, to fling my ſelfe downe headlong into the bottome of the Sea, thinking to make my ſelfe a Citizen of the kingdome of <hi>Thetis:</hi> when the Nymph <hi>Orythia,</hi> (who ſtill haunted mee, but in vaine, for my Loue) caught hold of mee by the arme, hindering mee from drowning my ſelfe, in thoſe ſalt Ocean waues.</p>
               <p>As that Traueller is aſtoniſht, who ſeeth the Skies to chaunge and skowle, whilſt the Clowdes looke darke and bigge with raine: euen ſo was I amazed, when I ſaw my ſelfe ſo ſtrangely preuented of my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I knewe not whether I ſhould take this which ſhee had done, in good part, or in ill, ſhee hauing diſturbed mee in my deſperate Action: Wherevpon, I looked vpon her, and ſighing, as one that had bene awaked out of a dead ſleepe, at what time he dreamed of ſome pleaſant matter, ſpake thus vnto her.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon (cruell as thou art) what is the reaſon I ſay, that thou ſhouldeſt thus oppoſe thy ſelfe againſt my good? What iniurie haſt thou receiued at my hands, that thou ſhouldeſt thus bee a let and obſtacle, vnto the ending of my miſcries? and wherefore ſhouldeſt thou beare ſo ſpitefull a diſdaine, to ſee mee ridde of all my griefes and troubles?</p>
               <p>Hard is my happe aboue all others, that when I am readie and willing to die, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd theſe my more then inſupportable torments, I am ſtill croſſed and barred in this my chiefeſt deſire.</p>
               <p>Alacke, Alacke, how vnlikely is it, that I ſhall finde comfort whilſt I liue, when being at the very point to die, I cannot finde helpe to diſpatch my ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Goe, goe, hard-harted as thou art, withdraw thy ſelfe from mee, (the chiefeſt foe I haue vnto my reſt) and let it ſuffice thee, (that my plagues abound too much alreadie) without thine aide, to make my woundes more mortall and deadly, then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The Nymph (hearing me ſay ſo, replyed thus.) Shepheard, Shepheard, if in the olde world there haue bene anie, that for caſting away themſelues, haue deſerued fame, (although they were farre vnworthie thereof,) yet was it for ſome great occaſion, and by reaſon of ſome laudable ſubject, and not for a vaine and trifeling matter, as thine is. And yet I will tell thee one thing, that ſo farre off is that man that murthereth himſelfe, from true glorie, to challenge vnto himſelfe the name of Conſtant, as quite contrarie to thy conceit, he rather deſerueth ſhame and infamie. For he that is conſtant, endureth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15406:173"/>aduerſitie, with the ſame countenance as he did proſperitie, without being moued or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated, one iotte at all, as that worthie Romane <hi>Marius</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Such as hauing not this reſolute vertue of Conſtancie, and becauſe they want true courage of the minde,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> to reſiſt theſe worldly afflictions, (ſeeke ſtraitwayes how to ridde themſelues of their liues) deſerue no praiſe or commendations at all, but ought to be accounted as moſt abiect, and white-liuered Cowards.</p>
               <p>Doeth he merite to taſte of pleaſure, that neuer ſuffered paine? to be a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who neuer did obey? or to be partaker of honour, who neuer did hazard himſelfe to winne the ſame? I thinke not.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, ſuch men deſerue no grace nor fauour of the Gods at all, who cannot patiently beare out ſuch tribulations, as are ſent them from aboue, by reaſon of their ſinnes:<note place="margin">A Seatence.</note> and therefore (thinking to eſcape them) goe about to murther themſelues.</p>
               <p>Tell mee I pray thee, ſhall the Gouernour of that Cittie be excuſed from blame, who whilſt the Cittizens thereof proſpered, and all things went well with them, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to continue and rule amongſt them? But no ſooner doth he ſee <hi>Fortune,</hi> to turne her ſmiling face from them, then hee giueth them the ſlippe, putting them to ſhift as well as they can for themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> is rather condemned then commended for killing himſelfe, at what time his Countrey had moſt need of him. Neither can hee be rightly tearmed magnanimous, hauing choſen ſo eaſie a death, to auoyd a farre greater euill; of which, he ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe to be vanquiſht and ouercome, ſeeing he durſt not ſtay to make proofe,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> and encounter with the ſame. And yet is hee worthie of farre more praiſe, then thou art. For he had a better colour to ſhadow his death then thou haſt, whom ſooliſh <hi>LOVE,</hi> hath thus ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>Such cannot be called valiant and reſolute, who for feare of ſuffering a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, cunninglie chuſe the leſſe, yeelding themſelues vnto an eaſier puniſhment, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid a farre more cruell. As <hi>Sceuola</hi> cannot be ſaide to haue a right braue minde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he burnt his arme, eſcaping by that meanes Death, which otherwiſe, hee could not eſchue,<note place="margin">A Seatence.</note> being a farre greater torment, then the firing of his fiſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſay that a man had all the occaſions in the world, whereby he might ſeeme to haue reaſon to maſſacre himſelfe, and that it were impoſſible for him to ſupport and endure, the anguiſh and agonies of his euer encreaſing ſorrowes; yet ought he ſtill to expect and looke for grace and fauour from the heauens, who after they haue powred downe vpon vs raigne and ſtormes, ſend vs moſt faire and comfortable weather.</p>
               <p>There is none ſo wretched, but that at one time or another, taſteth of the goodnes of the Gods, and though it be not by and by, yet commeth it ere it be long, ſo that, we ought alwaies rather to hope the beſt, then to feare the worſt; for death is the laſt refuge of mortallmen, which neuertheles they ought not to entertaine, without leaue of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour power,<note place="margin">A Searence.</note> the Lawe for bidding ſuch to be capable of Chriſtian buriall (but hauing a ſtake knockt into their bowels, to be laid in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon high waies) who as <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhall lay violent hands vpon themſelues, proclaiming them abroad, to be worſe then murtherers and homicides, and making them infamous for euer.</p>
               <p>Take heede then, that thou fall not into this labvrinth of ſhame. For if one muſt needs die, he muſt haue a great care of the preſeruation of his honour, and ſo to order the matter, that after his death, his memorie be not fouly ſported with ſome blacke fault; for then is the time (when he is out of the world) that a man is talked of, either well or ill: if well, then euery one lamenteth his abſence and loſſe, declaring how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and profitable he was vnto his countrie: If ill, then doe they ſpeake the worſt they can of him, becauſe they now feare him no more, knowing that dead men cannot bite at all.</p>
               <p>It is to ſmall purpoſe,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> although we haue carried our ſelues vprightly all our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, if the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> and end thereof be vnhoneſt and wicked. For the end doth make perfect the worke, and the goodlieſt building that is, is nothing worth, if the foundation thereof be not firme and ſure.</p>
               <p>Liue ſo, whileſt thou ſtaieſt in this world, as when thou ſhalt be dead, none may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lay reproach vnto thee.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:15406:173"/>
               <p>Doe ſo I pray thee; for it would be a double death vnto me, although I cannot die my ſelfe (if I ſuruiuing thee) ſhould heare thee ill ſpoken of, whom I haue alwaies ſo dearely loued.</p>
               <p>And to giue thee a moſt certaine and kind taſte, how much I account of thee, now thou art in this wofull perplexitie (although thy loue is the thing I moſt deſire, and that my chiefeſt happines conſiſteth in ſeeing thee without a Miſtris) yet to the end I may doe thee good, I am content to hurt mine owne ſelfe; eſteeming my ſelfe happie, in that I may redeeme thy life, with the loſſe of mine owne chiefeſt pleaſure: promiſing thee, to entreate thy hard-harted <hi>Diana</hi> in thy behalfe, to plead vnto her for thee, &amp; to ſuccour thee (to the vttermoſt of my power) in thy loue, which is the tormentor of my reſt and quietnes.</p>
               <p>O great proofe of a moſt perfect amitie in a Nymph! O rich witneſſe &amp; teſtimonie of her feruent affection! certaine was the aſſurance of her loyall friendſhip towards me, moſt beautifull was that vertue in her; moſt chaſte was her deſire; and as commendable was her willingnes therein: he is highly to be priſed and ſet by, that dieth for his friend,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> yet, that man, is farre more worthy of praiſe, who reſigneth all the intereſt he hath, in that thing which may make him moſt happie, to pleaſure another therwithall, whileſt he in the meane time for want therof, liueth in perpetual miſerie: eſpecially, if it be in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of Loue, which are ſo nice, and ſo full of iealouſie, as the Louer thinketh he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth nothing, although he looſe his life and libertie, ſo he be not couſoned of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fauour.</p>
               <p>Meane ſpace, poore <hi>Orythia</hi> is content, (ſo ſhe may helpe mee) to ouerthrowe her ſelfe, being reſolute to be moſt wretched for euer, to the end ſhee may ridde me from all my griefes and ſorrowes: whilſt I ſtand admiring her right generous minde, amazed at her conſtancie, highlie priſing her affection, and wonderfullie applauding her braue and ſtraunge conceit.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, I humblie thanked her for her kindneſſe, accepting of her gratious offer, vowing vnto her, that I will not die (as now) but rather expect ſome happie iſſue of her employment: And therwithall I proteſt, that I am the willinger to liue, becauſe I would ſatisfie her requeſt, not daring to refuſe her courteſie, becauſe I found my ſelfe ſo much beholding vnto her; and not for any certaine hope I did conceiue, that I ſhould finde grace at my Miſtris hands.</p>
               <p>For how could I thinke to finde ſuccor from her, who without occaſion giuen, had deliuered me ouer vnto death? whereas I might well haue bene counted barbarous and vngratefull, to haue denied the requeſt of this Nymph, eſpecially when it proceeded from an affection ſo loyall and perfect, Ingratitude being as foule a vice, as bloodie Murther.</p>
               <p>Vnthankfull perſons in the old time, were condemned vnto death,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> as the vnnaturall Sonnes of <hi>Sophocles</hi> were diſinherited (looſing all their father goods) becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed their aged father to doate for very age.</p>
               <p>Doe, as thou pleaſeſt (moſt gratious Nymph ſaid I) for I promiſe thee I will prolong my life at thy command, not that I expect thy enterpriſe may bring me any comfort, but onely, becauſe I feare to diſobey thee. Too much alreadie haſt thou bound me vnto thee, and therefore I beſeech thee, thinke I will ſooner diſpend my heart blood for thy ſake, then for mine owne.</p>
               <p>Goe then thy waies, and the heauens proſper thee in thy voyage, yet if this my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſhall chance to be any hinderance vnto thee, let me then entreate ſo much at thy hands, that I (depriuing my ſelfe of this loathed life) may be rid of theſe corſiues which ſtill torment me, and thou, be freed of this tedious charge, which ſo much troubles thee. Not ſo anſwered <hi>Orythia:</hi> Let mee alone, and I dare warrant thee all ſhall be well.</p>
               <p>Caſtles beſieged, yeeld not at the firſt parley, &amp; things that are brought to paſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, and with mature deliberation and aduiſe, continue longer, and ſeeme more ſweet afterward; for a man knoweth not the delightfulnes of pleaſure aright, if he haue not a taſt of paine before, and that which we haue moſt deareſt bought and hardlieſt come by, we alwaies hold moſt pretious, and of moſt account. Liue then in peace, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15406:174"/>ſuffer me to trie my fortune, which I perſwade my ſelfe, ſhall proue moſt happie in thy behalfe.</p>
               <p>So ſaying, the Nymph leaueth me, to take her iourney, minding to helpe me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe hurt her ſelfe, taking more care to heale my ſore, then to cure her owne wound.</p>
               <p>I could not chuſe but follow after her faire and ſoftly (yet aloofe) when by chance I met <hi>Fortunnio</hi> in the way, all to be blubbered with weeping, who thought verily that I had bene dead, he roming vp and downe the Forreſt like a man diſtraught, crying out, and calling ſtill vpon my name, whom none (ſaue an <hi>Ecco</hi>) anſwered.</p>
               <p>Much did he bewaile my loſſe, making greater moane for me then I deſerued, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt (moſt vnwiſely) he blamed Loue, as the Author of my death, and enuied moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt the ſtonie hart of my faire Miſtris.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner had he a ſight of me, but that he came running moſt cheerfully vnto me, and moſt tenderly embraced me, changing his former ſad and heauie countenance, not vnlike to him, who hauing found ſome pretious Iewell, which he before accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as loſt, beginneth to reuiue, and to be merrie againe.</p>
               <p>Then did he tell me how my Ladie had hard I was dead, ſhe belieuing the ſame for moſt certaine truth (for <hi>Orythia</hi> had for my good) ſpread abroad this report with as much ſpeed as poſſible ſhe could, which comming vnto my <hi>Dianas</hi> eares, was not a little vnpleaſant vnto her, as was found by the number of ſalt teares which ſhe ſhed, as a ſure reſtimonie of her true griefe.</p>
               <p>Which when I knew, I began to take comfort againe, and to reuiue my ſelfe with a freſh hope of ſome good ſucceſſe to come: and thereupon I compiled theſe verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, vpon the teares which my Miſtris ſhed in my behalfe, whileſt I attended with great deuotion the often wiſhed for returne of kinde <hi>Orythia.</hi>

               <p>This was the meſtfull Dittie I made, I being then ſo troubled in my minde, as I knew not well how to expreſſe my griefe, although I vſed many ſcalding ſighes and ſalt teares, to make manifeſt the ſame: I being of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, that it was impoſſible for me to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon forth the crueltie of Loue in his right colours: and yet did I ſeeke to comfort my ſelfe, in that I had many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions in my miſerie heretofore. O victorious <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for all thy valour, thou waſt conquered by louely <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who had a ſonne by thee called <hi>Ceſarion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thou, graue Emperour, and diuine Phyloſopher, diddeſt thou not doate vpon thy moſt vnhoneſt <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> whileſt thou thy ſelfe becameſt Loues priſoner, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thy wiſedome and greatnes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hanniball</hi> found his force too ſtrong for him, who although he had ſo often giuen the foile vnto the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet when he loſt his pretious libertie, through lying in <hi>Capua,</hi> and making Loue vnto a woman there, was ouercome by that temperate <hi>Romane, Scipio. Demetrius</hi> likewiſe, was ſo bewitched, with the faire Curtezan of <hi>Athens,</hi> as he ſtood in awe of her, as if he had bene her bond-ſlaue.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould leaue the earth, and flie vp into the heauens, wee ſhall finde the Gods themſelues haue bene ſchollers in <hi>Cupids</hi> ſchoole. For did not <hi>Ioue</hi> loue <hi>Europa: Lida, Alcumena:</hi> and diuers others? <hi>Phoebus, Caſſandra, Daphne,</hi> and many moe? <hi>Mars, Venus: Venus Adonis: Diana, Endimion:</hi> and I know not whome beſides.</p>
               <p>Why then, if it be ſo, I muſt needs ſay, that thy power extendeth farre and neere, thou being as mightie in the heauens, as thou art here vpon the earth. <hi>Fortunio</hi> ſeeing mee in this humour, beganne thus.</p>
               <p>How now man? but euen now thou ſhewedſt thy ſelfe to be conquerour ouer thy paſſions, ſetting a good face on the matter, whileſt thou didſt bare out the brunt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And now againe, thou ſeemeſt as a recreant, to yeeld vnto thy anguiſh and ſorrow,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15406:175"/>crying out and vexing thy ſelfe, as if thou wouldeſt die vpon the ſuddaine: what is the reaſon of this alteration and change? It is a credit for a man to change from vice to vertue, and of bad, to become good, but not to goe on ſtill, growing worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> is praiſed for amending his wicked life, and for becomming a new man, where his Sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> is condemned, in that he forgot himſelfe in his latter daies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming an Idolater, and a whoremonger, amongſt his concubines.</p>
               <p>Thinkeſt thou, that it is enough for thee to ſay, thou art not able to reſiſt the force of Loue, and that other mens faults are ſufficient to excuſe and defend thine? That thiefe is not exempted from puniſhment, who excuſeth himſelfe (hauing robbed from others) that he hath but done, as an other hath done before him; for though it be lawfull to imitate ſuch actions as are commendable and vertuous, yet is it not tollerable, to doe what is wicked and villainous.</p>
               <p>This colour then will not ſerue thee, and therefore if (as thou not long ſince diddeſt affirme) thou loueſt the inward qualities of the minde, without coueting that fleſhly pleaſure (which Louers ſo much ſtudie to obtaine (although with great labour and loſſe) but what is the reaſon thou takeſt on thus?</p>
               <p>And why ſhouldeſt thou ſeeme to diſpaire, being readie euery houre almoſt to goe about to giue ouer the world? For louing the ſoule, (onely) the bodie, which is but a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet for the ſame, cannot hinder thy affection, neither canſt thou hope to receiue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contentment or pleaſure of thy loue, then in conceit: whereas thou doing thus (as thou doeſt) thou wilt make the world belieue, that thy loue is of another manner of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then thou wouldeſt perſwade vs, it being the common faſhion of ſottiſh Louers, and ſuch as deſire ſenſuall delights, to crie out and lament, as if they were readie to die, when they cannot taſte the ſweetnes of the ſame: as the ſicke Patient dieth for want of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, that ſhould expell ſuch ſuperfluous humours, as hurt him.</p>
               <p>Now if thy Loue be ſuch (as thou ſaieſt) that it neither demandeth nor expecteth in any ſort this pleaſure, what maketh thee for want of enioying the ſame, to run ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death? wringing thy hands, and making ſuch pittious moane, as is ſtrange to behold?</p>
               <p>Therefore are ſuch men farre more furious and mad, then thoſe ſenſeleſſe Bedlems are, who without cauſe, ſeeke to offer violence vnto themſelues, imitating the heathen people of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who vſed to burne themſelues, without any cauſe at all, but onely when the toy tooke them in the head: for moſt deare ought we to hold our life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is vnrecouerable: neither muſt we forgoe it, vnleſſe for ſome great occaſion, as either for the benefit of our common-wealth, or for ſpeciall good and aduancement of all our friends. I ſeeing <hi>Fortunto</hi> to be ſo earneſt, replied thus.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Fortunio,</hi> I cannot ſee how a man can loſe a leſſer loſſe, then the ſhortning of his daies: for looſing them, he lighteth vpon a path that leadeth him into eternall reſt, and therefore he is not hindered at all: reſembling that marchant, who exchangeth bad marchandiſe, for ſuch as are moſt pretious and rich. For a ſmaller matter then mine, thouſands of wiſe men haue ſhortned their liues. A witnes whereof, is that wiſe man, who following <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and much fauoured of him, gaue not ouer for all that, to erect a great pile of wood, which he ſetting a fire, moſt cheerfully leapt therein (without ſturring once) and ſo was there buried. But perhaps you will aske me what was the cauſe that vrged him thereunto: truely none; but onely becauſe he would leaue this mortall life, to inherit a life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>But ſay, that no liuely apprehention of intollerable griefe did force a man to this deſire, yet are the very defects of Nature, and the deſire to become immortall, ſufficient enough to imprint moſt deeply this conceit in his ſoule: eſpecially, if (after death) we ſhall be free from feeling of any paine, according vnto the groſſe errour of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Epicure. For is it not farre better neuer to be borne, then to liue and endure miſerie?</p>
               <p>But we flie higher in our thoughts, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe Phyloſophers: for we by this meanes, ſet not onely an end vnto our wretchednes, but we change them into glorie &amp; content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our fraile and fleſhly bodie, into an immortall ſtate, free from all corruption.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:15406:175"/>
               <p>Therefore my concluſion is, that ſeeſing the onely maimes of Nature, without any other accident of euill, are of force enough to imprint within vs this deſire of death, we are not to be reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, if we die, in as much as we are ſtirred vp vnto death, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe imperfections, as alſo by reaſon of ſuch a ſubiect of deadly griefe, as can no way be remedied nor holpen but by the fatall Deſtinies; and thoſe that doe contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, cannot be compared for conſtancie and vertue, vnto thoſe women, who (one ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with another) leaped into the flaming fire, wherein their dead ſpouſes were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: a deepe paſſion of true ſorrow, and a vehement deſire to follow their husband, being that which did animate them vnto this death.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch as are in diſpaire, for euer ſeeing ioyfull daies in this world, haue not they the greateſt reaſon of all to die? which (if any ſuch) ſhall refuſe, they are of a more baſe and timerous diſpoſition, then thoſe women afore ſaid, ſeeing that in death onely, a man incountreth with quiet reſt, as (whileſt we liue) we are yoaked and tyed vnto troubles.</p>
               <p>The ſage Hebrew King, praiſeth in his prouerbes, the dead, more then he doth the liuing, death being the ſecureſt harbor of all other, where when we are arriued, we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from rowing any more in the dangerous barge of this turbulent world. Fond is that Pilot, who (through the fauour of the heauens, hauing gotten into a ſafe creake and bay, will needs venter backe againe into the maine Sea, at what time a tempeſt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and ſo ſuffereth ſhipwracke.</p>
               <p>Thoſe great perſonages in times paſt, in ſteed of being afraid of death, tooke death as the chiefeſt remedie againſt all their croſſes and misfortunes. Tryumphant <hi>Caſar,</hi> who enioyed all the delights that might be, although he had reaſon to couet to liue (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bleſſed with ſo much happines) was ſo farre off from being afraid of death, as he would needs entertaine the ſame, although he might haue auoyded it, if he had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſhall we then (who quite contrarie to him) are ouercharged with thouſands of plagues, being (in reſpect of him) moſt vile, baſe and abiect vaſſalles, to whom diſgraces are common, and all pleaſures, hatefull aduerſaries, ſeare that, which he in the chiefeſt of all his felicities neuer once ſo much as doubted?</p>
               <p>So to doe, would argue vs to haue ſmall courage, and we ſhould be like vnto the baſe minded Macedonian King, who rather then he would die, ſuffered himſelfe to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aliue in tryumph, through the ſtretes of <hi>Rome,</hi> being afterward ſtarued to death in priſon. Yet farre more generous, and of a brauer reſolution, was <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (although a fillie woman) who deceiued the expectation of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by killing her ſelfe, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him thereby, from beautifying his glorious tryumphant Chariot, with the liuely ſhewe of her owne proper perſon.</p>
               <p>No, no, before this miſchiefe ſhall ſeaze vpon me, and that diſgrace ſhall ſtill try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer me; I will end both my life and my lamentations all at once, like that gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Egyptian Princes.</p>
               <p>Neither is this argument forcible enough, to ſay, that becauſe one loueth onely the inward qualities of his Miſtris, therefore he ſhould not die; for farre greater is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, and the diſtreſſe is more violent, which proceedeth from thoſe, who haue loued chaſtely, without offering any outrage or vnſeemly behauiour to diſcredit themſelues, then it is amongſt other vaine Louers: and therefore thy Miſtris haue the leſſe reaſon to be ſo hard-harted and vnkinde towards them, when they are vrged vnto no ſuch villainie.</p>
               <p>This therefore is my opinion, that death is an hundred times more ſweeter then life, and that the onely defaults of Nature, without other reaſons that proceed from ſorrow, are of force ſufficient to make vs wiſh and venter vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the free man is onely happie, and free can none be, whileſt they are intangled in the nets of the miſeries of this world, death onely being of power to infranchiſe vs, and therefore is it moſt happie, and moſt neceſſarie for man.</p>
               <p>While I was (thus) diſputing with my old acquaintance and friend; curteous <hi>Orythia,</hi> was nothing forgetfull of me, who comming before my Ladie, pleaded hard in my behalfe, ſhe beginning thus. Certainly (beautious <hi>Diana</hi>) moſt cruell is that man, that ſeeketh the life of an other who neuer offended him.</p>

               <p>How then can he purge himſelfe, who hauing neuer bene abuſed by ſuch a one, yet worketh all the meanes he can to cut his throate?</p>
               <p>It is the propertie of Tyrants (baniſhed from the companie of men) from whom through rigour of their owne lawe and wills, they take both life and liuing without any reaſonable cauſe giuen them, to bath their murthering hands in giltleſſe blood, but ſuch as be godly and iuſt Princes, will neuer commit ſo hainous an act: much leſſe ought La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to acqaint themſelues therewithall, they being the very patternes of compaſſion, of pittie, and of mildnes; and not of blood, of murther, or of vengance.

               <p>Doe not you thinke, that it were better for a woman to looſe (ſomewhat that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto her, then to deſtroy the life of a man (not to be recouered any more) the life I ſay of a man, which the Gods themſelues haue firſt breathed into them, beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them?</p>

               <p>Let vs then ſhun this Sauadge minde, and barbarous fault, as a deadly peſtilence, and let vs driue it from vs, as we would doe a mortall poyſon from our bodies, for it killeth our good name and renowme, which ought to be dearer vnto vs, then our pretious liues by odds.</p>

               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:15406:177"/>
               <p>For I am not ſo ignorant, but that I knowe pure and chaſte Loue, to be a moſt diuine and beautifull Vertue, and the honeſt affection of right generous, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike ſpirites, to be commendable and praſſe-worthie: ſeeing they are of power to make famous our memories for euer.</p>
               <p>All Portraitures, Tables, Counterfaites, and Pictures, ſoone looſe their colours and decay, be they neuer ſo excellently well drawne, quickly are they ſpoiled, and ſoone doth Time deuour them. No Picture of <hi>Achilles</hi> now remaineth, &amp; yet his praiſe doth, through <hi>Homers</hi> Muſe. None of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, although both <hi>Apelles</hi> and <hi>Lyſippus,</hi> two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Painters had often drew him. And yet although their famous works be conſumed and gone, the braue writings of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> (blazoning forth the life of this mighty Monark) liue and flouriſh. Neither is the verſe of <hi>Virgil</hi> dead, ringing out the vertues of <hi>AEneas,</hi> although the counterfaites of that <hi>Troyan</hi> Prince, be all turned vnto duſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo, if that <hi>Arcas,</hi> be (yet) aliue, I wiſh he ſo may ſtill continue; thy onely intreaty and requeſt being of force to command more of mee then this, ſeeing it is thy pleaſure he ſhould be entertained.</p>
               <p>But if he will ſo vnaduiſedly, raſhly, and ſo fooliſhly offend his owne ſelfe, I heere waſh my handes, as cleare from this matter, proteſting heere before all, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of his death, becauſe I neuer gaue him any ſuch occaſion of diſcontentment: If perchaunce he haue found me, that I haue not bene ſo curteous, nor ſo affable vnto him at one time, as I haue bin at an other: Or if that I haue looked more heauy &amp; ſad now and then, then I haue vſed to doe heretofore. Thinketh he therefore, that he hath iuſt reaſon to lay all the blame vpon me, as if I had bene ſhe, that was the Author of his ouerthrow? If ſo, he is deceiued. For our bodies (which are ſubiect vnto the influences of the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Signes) are either ioyfull or ſadde, according vnto their motions.</p>
               <p>This being the cauſe, that when we meet (by fortune) with one of our acquaintance, and hee is (as then) troubled with many thoughts in his mind, or ſome bad celeſtiall Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is predominate ouer him: wee then, (by his ſower countenance) would take him for our enemie, but no ſooner is his humour paſt and gone from him, but hee is our good friend againe, and as kinde vnto vs, as euer he was before.</p>
               <p>The weaker muſt alwaies yeeld (ſomewhat) vnto the ſtronger, becauſe the one is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diſtraught, nor carryed away with our publike affaires, where the other are drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with much buſineſſe, and diuers cares (which hindereth them oftentimes) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, or thinke vpon their inferiours.</p>
               <p>Let him then liue, if he be (as yet) liuing: For neuer let <hi>Diana</hi> wiſh to liue, to ſee that day, wherein ſhe ſhall be reproached to haue bene the cauſe of his death, who by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings doth eternize the Vertuous, eſpecially, when I may preſerue his life, and that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to haue any thing of mee, that is preiudiciall vnto mine honour.</p>
               <p>This was the anſwere of wiſe <hi>Diana,</hi> vnto faire <hi>Orythia,</hi> who moſt kindely thanking her in my behalfe, came merrilie away, ſeeking to find me out: Who no ſooner ſaw me, but that ſhee deliuered vnto me my Ladies minde, and therewithall, aduiſed me to goe preſently vnto her, and to preſent my ſelfe vnto her.</p>
               <p>How to requite this curteous Nymphe for ſo exceeding a fauour done vnto mee, I know not; Whilſt I was framing a ſet ſpeech in my minde, to ſhew my ſelfe in ſome ſort gratefull vnto her. How now (quoth ſhe) it is no time now to ſtudie? away, and get you gone vnto your Miſtris. As for thanks, I looke for none at your handes, I hauing done but what was my dutie, ſeeing ſuch as are bound, muſt needs obey: yet I beſeech the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of <hi>Loue,</hi> to make thee once to pittie me, who wiſh thee no worſe fortune, then I doe vnto mine owne ſoule, although thy chiefe happines, muſt needs be my bad ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>And hauing ſo ſayd, caſting a pittious eye towards me, and ſighing moſt heauilie, as if her heart would haue burſt, ſhe went away from me, and ſo left me. I could not chuſe but weepe, thinking vpon her: When (remembring my Ladies meſſage) I ſet forward ſpeedilie to wend towards her, carrying in my hand a certain Sonnet, which I had made in her praiſe not long before, meaning to preſent it vnto her. Being arriued where ſhe was, I found her accompanied with other Nymphes, ſitting by the ſide of a Fountaine, which iſſued forth from out the veines of a ſtately Rocke, the water whereof, was farre clearer then any Criſtall, in whoſe bottome was a dainty yealow Sand, ſuch as that of <hi>Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:15406:177"/>intermixed with a number of precious ſtones, of ſundry colours, &amp; had a man bene able to haue thruſt his nimble hand deep enogh, he might (without wetting of his arme) with exceeding great pleaſure, haue taken a number of little fiſhes, running vp &amp; downe, and playing moſt wantonly there: one while, hyding themſelues within the entrailes of the grauell, and another while, in ſundrie corners and holes of the Fountaine.</p>
               <p>Whilſt being ſlipperie, and skipping too and fro, they would moſt cunninglie get out of the fingers of him that had caught them. From this Fountaine, there came forth two ſweet Riuers, which growing into a great water, ranne round about the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, looſing themſelues as they fell into the Sea adioyning.</p>
               <p>This Fountaine was ſhadowed ouer with beautious Cipreſſe, and louely Orenge ttees, the ſweete buds and bloſſomes whereof, was able to rauiſh the mindes euen of bruit Beaſts: within the Rock, were many ſeates to reſt on, framed by nature ſo artificiallie, as no cunning could any way come neare them, they being alwaies couered with pleaſing Camomell, the more to delight the ſenſe of man.</p>
               <p>The ground all along was full of greene graſſe, and other pretie hearbes, which the teeth of Cattell had neuer ſpoyled, nor ouer-heate of the day, ſcorched or burned.</p>
               <p>Manie ſweete Roſe-trees ſprung forth, from out the ſides of that Rocke, in diuers places, and that in ſo iuſtand ſeemly an order, as you would haue thought they had bene planted, and ſet by the handy-labour of ſome curious Gardiner: whilſt all ſort of Roots ſprouted out in their right colours, the odoriferous ſent whereof was ſuch, and the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the place ſo delightfull, as you would haue thoght your ſelfe in Paradice, as long as you had continued there. Neuer was there Pallace more beautifull.</p>
               <p>That Fountaine which the warlike Horſe cauſed to ſpring out of the ground,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> with the hooſe of his foote, was nothing ſo daintie, (although more commended, by ſuch as dranke of the water thereof) they being inſpired with the gift of Poetrie euer after.</p>
               <p>In this ſo pleaſant a ſeate then, did I finde gratious <hi>Diana,</hi> paſſing away her time, one while, with waſhing her beautifull face: an other while, her Diamond eyes, and then againe, her long and ſlender hands. No care as then troubled her, neither was ſhe buſied in canuaſing in her braines,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> any ſerious matter of weighty importance.</p>
               <p>As that great Sacrificer, who thinking to ſacrifice to <hi>Iuno</hi> the goddeſſe of Riches, (finding her Image either bloodie, or ſweating) ſuddainely withdraweth himſelfe from thence, conſulting with his fellow-Prieſt, about the ſtrange chance, before he beginne his Ceremonies againe; Euen ſo, I ſeeing ſo rare a beautie, ſtood as one amazed, without ſpeech, and as if I had bene in a ſound.</p>
               <p>And now I began to conſider within my ſelfe, whether I were beſt to goe forwards on my iourney, and offer my Preſent vnto this Nymphe, or whether without ſpeaking vnto her, I ſhould turne backe againe, and goe from whence I came.</p>
               <p>For although ſuch onely finde Fortune to fauour them, who are venturous, and of bold ſpirits, (yet thought I) it were farre better, not to trye all, (eſpecially, when a mans life or credit lyeth therevpon) then like bold Bayard, to runne bluntly onwards, and ſo to take repulſe, and be denyed of his ſute. For more ſure and certaine is the meane life, and eſtate, then is the richeſt and higheſt in authority, wherin there is nothing but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and danger.</p>
               <p>This was the cauſe I ſtood ſo long debating of the matter within my ſelfe, whether I were beſt to purſue my firſt enterpriſe or no:<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> For hardly dare a man ſpeak to ſuch a one as we feare &amp; reſpect, but in the end, the ſame thing that made mee moſt to doubt, did rid me out of the ſame, ſtifling my feare, &amp; driuing away all ſorrow from me. For my Miſtris hauing eſpied mee, (who was neare readie to goe back againe) called me vnto her.</p>
               <p>O how ſweete and comfortable was that ſound vnto mee? I thinking I had bene called by ſome God there-abouts. Gratious and full of courteſie was her ſpeech, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as I counted my name moſt bleſſed, becauſe it was pronounced by my louelie Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>No longer will I maruell now, although the voyces of Saintes heeretofore, haue bene of power to call vp dead Coarſes, from out the bottome of their graues, (where they lay buried) reſtoring them vnto life againe: ſince that of my faire Miſtriſſe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to driue away all ſadneſſe and ſorrow from mee, and to reuiue freſh hope within me.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:15406:178"/>
               <p>This made me draw neare vnto her, when after many dutious Ceremonies done by me vnto her, I preſented her with my Paper, which the opening, with a cheerfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, read this Sonnet following.</p>

               <p>As ſhe read theſe Verſes, ſhee ſeemed to ſmile,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> giuing mee a verie kinde looke, and many thankes for the ſame. As the Vine-worker reioyceth, when comming into the field, (betimes in the morning) hee findeth his Vine ſprung forth, and readie to budde all ouer, which promiſeth him a bountifull Largeſſe, to come from <hi>Bacchus:</hi> Euen ſo began I to be light for ioy, to ſee ſo cheerfull a countenance to come from her, hoping to haue ſome good fortune afterward.</p>
               <p>O how ſundrie and ſuddaine, are the alterations in loue? One while a Louer is dead, and then againe, he is aliue: now hee is merrie, and then by and by, he is ſadde: a ſmall matter, being able to make him hope or diſpaire, as a litle Leuen, maketh a great deale of Paſte ſower.</p>
               <p>But as I was moſt vnfortunate before, ſo beganne I now to be moſt happie of all: For no ſooner had my Miſtris read what was written, but ſhee began thus. It is great griefe and hart vnto a gallant Courtier, who can, and faine would, make ſome excellent proofe of his valour: when hee cannot meete with a fitte place, or fielde, wherein he might exerciſe and put in practiſe his Chiualrie.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, it is great pittie (Shepheard) that thou canſt not encounter a ſubiect, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thy penne, which might be able, and of ſufficiencie enough, to make thy <hi>Muſe</hi> ſhewe her ſelfe abroad, in her right colours. For this Poeticall veine of thine, without hauing ſome rare, or diuine matter to animate it, and to ſet it forward, is like vnto a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie body that hath no ſoule: which, although it ſhewe faire and beautifull, yet can it doe little good,<note place="margin">A compariſon.</note> becauſe it wanteth life. Or it may be compared vnto a large and fatte fielde, bringing forth much graſſe, which is a teſtimonie of his fertile richneſſe: But yet for want of labour and ſowing, yeeldeth not anie Corne at all.</p>
               <p>I aſſure thee, I am right heartilie ſorrie, that thou wanteſt an excellent ſubiect, whereon to worke. For then, I verily perſwade my ſelfe, we ſhould ſee moſt admirable conceits to come from thy <hi>Muſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for my ſelfe, I neither will, nor dare refuſe theſe Verſes, which thou haſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon mee, they ſanouring of the ſame ſweetneſſe, for then worthilie mighteſt thou iudge mee to be more prouder then the Gods, who thankfullie accept of the ſmalleſt gifts, that mortall men doe offer them.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:15406:178"/>
               <p>But yet I could wiſh with all my hart, that they had bene meant vnto ſome other more vertuous Saint: For worthie things belong vnto ſuch as are worthie perſonages, great matters vnto great &amp; mightie Potentates, &amp; what is honorable, is due vnto the vertuous: no otherwiſe, then ſhame &amp; reproach do belong vnto the infamous, &amp; ſuch as be wicked.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, I will not giue ouer to account of thy <hi>Muſe,</hi> ſeeing that (for all ſhee hath taken ſo leane and barren a ſubiect as my ſelfe) ſhe doth ſo well, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof, ſhe ſheweth herſelfe to be the more worthie of commendation and praiſe.</p>
               <p>But farre better, and more perfect (by great oddes) would ſhe appeare, if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherevpon ſhe had built, had bene but as goodly, as ſhee her ſelfe is faire. For then no doubt, but ſhe would bring forth moſt ſtraunge and matchleſſe workes, as of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents, ſweete and well-fauoured children are borne.</p>
               <p>Ah, ſay not ſo, moſt ſacred Nymph (replyed I) although theſe your ſpeeches are like vnto a lowlie vertue, wherein (the more you humble your ſelfe) the more you are exalted; For what Goddeſſe is there raigning in the Skies aboue, that meriteth more praiſe then thou doeſt? And what mortall woman is there liuing, that carrieth a minde more chaſte, a heart more vertuous, a beautie more excellent, or a iudgement more perfect, then thou thy ſelfe doeſt?</p>
               <p>Although great perſons are by the benefite of <hi>Fortune,</hi> raiſed and aduaunced vnto many Titles of honour, and are enriched with Treaſures mightilie, we cannot therefore ſay, that for that onely cauſe, they are more worthie of praiſe, then ſuch meaner crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as are barred from ſuch great wealth and authoritie, ſo long as they be as curteous as the others: For true glory is not giuen to blinde and cheating <hi>Fortune,</hi> but vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and heauenly Vertue.</p>
               <p>He is worthy of little praiſe, who hath nothing of his owne, but is faine to borrow of others: &amp; ſuch are rich men, who throgh the aduancement of nature,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> &amp; not of their own induſtrie, enioy that which they haue: wheras ſuch as are wiſe, (who of their own ſelues, without the help of others) ſhew many proofs of vertue, deſerue to be comended indeed. Poore <hi>Homer</hi> is more accounted of, then rich <hi>Agamemnon:</hi> laudleſſe <hi>Maro,</hi> then coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <hi>Craſſus:</hi> &amp; poore <hi>Solon,</hi> more then golden <hi>Croeſus.</hi> And ſo (faire Nymph) although thou haſt not the name of a Goddeſſe, (ſeeing in deſert, thou doeſt merite the ſame) why ſhouldeſt thou refuſe that praiſe, that is rightly due, and belonging vnto the ſoueraigne powers aboue.</p>
               <p>But I know thy minde, and by thy ſpeech doe gather what thou meaneſt. Thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to refuſe the fruits of my <hi>Muſe,</hi> (and not without great reaſon) becauſe they are too weake, and vnable to diſplay, and ſet abroach thy vertues. For as thoſe that are excellent Poets, greatly honor wiſe and worthy ſpirits: ſo ſuch as be groſſe and vnlearned, rather bring diſcredite, then credite vnto them, by their harſh and fooliſh vorſes; It being far better for a braue <hi>Heroicall</hi> minde, not to be praiſed at all, then to heare himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by the mouth of an illiterated and ſimple Poetizer.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe thou refuſeſt my verſe, but it is certaine, that the more Vertue flieth from glorie, the more doeth glorie follow her. The Sages in times paſt did well,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the praiſes, which were attributed vnto them, and becauſe they would not be ſeene; when they put in practiſe many rare and admirable exploites, they hidde themſelues cloſe, within ſome vnfrequented Deſart or other.</p>
               <p>And yet neuertheleſſe, they had their due in the ende, and when they leaſt dreamed of any ſuch matter. Glorie paſſeth through the pikes of all difficulties,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> yet it deſcendeth downe into the Tombs of the dead: ſounding like a Trumpet, the due praiſes of manie when they are buryed, who whilſt they liued, would not accept of any ſuch matter. For as the Cloudes, although they ſhew thicke, darke, and gloomie, cannot for all that, hinder the brightnes of the Sunne, but for all their foggie vapours, hee will breake out, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his ſplendent Maieſtie; Euen ſo, (maugre the cruell times, yea, and in deſpite of their owne ſelues) the vertuous are euer honoured, whom glorie it ſelfe, doeth neuer abandon or forſake. And therefore (gratious Nymph) reiect not what my <hi>Muſe</hi> in moſt humble manner beſtoweth vpon thee, ſeeing ſhe doth the beſt ſhe can. For the good will of the giuer, &amp; not the richnes of the gift, doth perfect, &amp; make better the preſent. Poore folke giue as much (althogh it be of little value) conſidering their abilitie, as the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15406:179"/>ſort doe,<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> although they beſtow neuer ſo much: and the ſillie widowes Mite, was as well accepted, as the richeſt mens golde, which in the Temple was offered.</p>
               <p>Dainethen to make me ſo fortunate, as to vouchſafe to accept of me to chaunt forth thy praiſes; And doubt not, but ſo earneſt a deſire ſhall ſo much animate and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage my <hi>Muſe,</hi> as ſhe will think nothing can ſee me to be too hard for her. For this cauſe onely do I liue: nothing ſo much keeping life within my bodie, as a zealous deſire (He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald-like) to blazon forth thy vertues, which If I thought I might not obtaine, I would chuſe rather to die then liue.</p>
               <p>My gifts are but ſmall, and yet more commendable ſhalt thou be, for accepting of them, then if they had bene richer: becauſe the world ſhall ſee, that not anie couetous humor of gaine, nor any worth of the preſent, moued mee to make a tender of the ſame, but only an humble mind, &amp; the right noblenes, of thy more then curteous own nature.</p>
               <p>Thus did I argue for my ſelfe, when my faire Saint, who tooke ſome pleaſure in my ſpeech, beganne to anſwer me in this manner.</p>
               <p>Neuer ought any honeſt praiſe to be reiected, becauſe it proceedeth from good will. The Gods themſelues taking in good part the praiſes of the ſimple, as well as of thoſe that are more mightie. I therefore accept of thine, if thou thinkeſt there be any thing in mee, (as I doubt me there is not) worthy of thy ſtudie, but yet with this condition, that like a faithfull <hi>Hyſtoriographer,</hi> and not as a fawning Poet, thou ſet downe the truth.</p>
               <p>For as that Crowe,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> when ſhe was deſpoyled of her feathers, which ſhee had borrowed of the other Byrds, became naked and bare; &amp; as that face is found to be more fowle, and fuller of wrinkles, which is vſed to be dawbed with paintings, then that which neuer hath any other, then her naturall beautie; So when one is praiſed, &amp; afterwards his defects and vitious life commeth to be knowne abroad, he is more diſgraced with infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But aboue all, I would wiſh thee, to haue ſpeciall regard vnto this: that thy works (if by chaunce thou ſhalt find, I be worthy of thy Inuention) breed neither iealouſie of me, nor malicious enuie againſt me, the two common plagues amongſt all men.</p>
               <p>For it were farre better to liue bare and poorely, and without beeing made famous abroad, then to be rich, and be enuied of all, and ſo to purchaſe the ill will of euery one.</p>
               <p>This onely deſire, was <hi>Caſars</hi> death, his enemies bearing malice at his vertues: and this was the loſſe of the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who was hated for his exceeding great victories.</p>
               <p>So ſaid the beautious Nymph, and that with ſo good a grace, as (although ſhee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make a ſhewe, that ſhee was vnwilling to accept of the praiſes of my <hi>Muſe</hi>) yet did ſhe ſo wittilie order the matter, as I found by the circumſtance of her diſcourſe, ſhe did not altogether reiect mine offer.<note place="margin">A Sentence.</note> Quickly did I find her meaning, for (who marketh ſo narrowly the manner &amp; faſhion, the geſture, and the countenance of his Miſtris, as doeth the Louer, ſeeing he findeth either good or hurt, in the leaſt glaunce of her eyes?</p>
               <p>Soone did I conceiue that ſhe did not differ much from my minde, and I made my ſelfe ready to anſwer her: when behold, we might ſuddenly heare a great noiſe a far off, as if it had bene of fome wilde Beaſt, that brake through buſhes, paſt through hedges, and forced the very trees to ſtoope and ſhake, with his furious running againſt them.</p>
               <p>This noiſe made my Ladie, and all her company maruellouſly afraid, for it was moſt terrible in their cares: wherevpon, they began to take their flight, and that they might runne the ſwifter, the feare of this ſtraunge accident, lent them wings.</p>
               <p>I ſeeing this, tooke my worthie <hi>Diana</hi> vnder the arme, (the greateſt fauour that euer I had before receiued of her) and yet was it not willingly graunted by her: For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would ſhee haue ſuffered me to haue done ſo much, but that the danger, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſitie was ſuch, I helping her the better to get vp vnto the toppe of the foreſaid high Rocke, at the foote of which, was (as I tolde you before) a moſt faire and cleare Chriſtiall Fountaine. When beeing there, wee thought our ſelues to be quite out of all perill and danger: and that if it were a Beare, or a Lyon, or any Tyger, it could not ouer
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15406:179"/>eaſily get vp to the top of the ſame: or at leaſt, that we could not be diſcouered in ſo high a place: but yet neuertheleſſe, my Ladie ſtill quaking &amp; trembling, as one that could not abandon her penſiuenes vpon the ſuddaine.</p>
               <p>She endured, that I ſhould holde her vnder the arme, whileſt in the meane time, I ventured to touch her white and daintie hand, which was to me, as if I had bene in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, for ſo much did feare poſſeſſe her, as ſhe neuer thought of any ſuch matter. O what a happie time had I as then? and how much was I beholding vnto that wilde beaſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the terror thereof, did make me to ſhake? A right holy day was that day vnto me, and the happieſt that euer I had in all my life.</p>
               <p>Great was the pleaſure my poore heart felt as then, when I had that libertie to touch thoſe rare and victorious hands, as long ſince theſe deſperate Pirates had,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> who came from farre, onely to kiſſe the fiſt of <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Affrican,</hi> after he had taken his farewell of vngratefull <hi>Rome.</hi> Neuer was there ſo lillie a white hand, neuer one ſo ſoft and ſupple, for many braue mindes had they brought vnder their yoake, they not once daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her command.</p>
               <p>Although this fauour was but ſmall, yet ſtood I ſo much in awe to diſpleaſe her, as I trembled more for feare of her, then I did of the Monſter. For twiſe had I made triall of her anger alreadie, which I felt more hot then fire it ſelfe, doubting greatly leaſt I ſhould fall into the like danger againe.</p>
               <p>Thus, whileſt I now and then touched her ſweet hands, ſhe neuer perceiued what I did, whether it were, either becauſe ſhe made ſhewe that ſhe knew it not, or becauſe feare had ſo hindered her, that ſhe could not conceiue of any ſuch thing: for where dread ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth vpon one, there can be no other thoughts, ſhe driuing them away, and making her ſelfe onely Miſtris of that place. But howſoeuer it was, it fell out well for me, to enioy ſo great a happines.</p>
               <p>But if the onely touching of her hand, was of force to bring me into an Extaſie of ioy and pleaſure, what then (thinke you) would the kiſſing of the ſame haue wrought in me, if I had had licenſe to haue done ſo much vnto her?</p>
               <p>No doubt I had died through extreame delight, as that Romane Gentlewoman did,<note place="margin">An Example.</note> when ſhe ſawe her ſonne returned home ſafe and aliue, from that bloodie battaile of <hi>Cannas,</hi> where ſhe thought he had bene ſlaine.</p>
               <p>But I was not worthy of ſo great a good, and therefore was well contented with the fortune I had before. Meane ſpace, this beaſt commeth with a moſt ſtrange boldnes, there not being his like in all the world, affrighting not onely the Gods of the woods, but men, and other ſenſeleſſe creatures alſo.</p>
               <p>The Serpent <hi>Python</hi> was neuer ſo horrible, the <hi>Hydra</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſlew, not halfe ſo terrible: nor that great <hi>Crocadile,</hi> that was taken vpon the bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto King <hi>Ptolomie</hi> by his fiſhers, was halfe ſo hideous or fierce.</p>
               <p>He had the head of a wilde Boore, hauing ſharpe and great prickles round about his throate, as red as any blood: his haire, his skinne, and his eares, were as a Lyons: his bellie as a Leopard. His taile as a Serpent, his feete as a Griffon, &amp; he had wings as an Eagle, <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monſter PRIDE.</note> with great proudnes did he come to drinke at that cleare Fountaine, I wondring much, that the verie ſpring thereof did not drie vp, at the ſight of ſo vgly a Monſter.</p>
               <p>He drinke at his pleaſure, whileſt very dread kept vs within a little hole, which we by chance had found out vpon the top of the Rocke, into which we had gotten, becauſe we would not be ſeene of this odious beaſt, but when we ſawe him winged, we then began to feare, more then euer we had done before; for then we thought verily, that he would take his flight vp, vnto the Rocke, and ſo deuour vs, who ſtood trembling and ſhaking, becauſe we imagined it could not be but that he had ſeene vs: for alwaies feare turneth euerything to the worſt, iudging ſiniſterly of the ſame.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, he had ſeene vs indeed, and (no doubt) to our great hurt, had he made after vs, to finde our feare true,<note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humili. tie.</note> but that there arriued vpon the ſuddaine a young Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozell plainely apparelled, in white linnin, with a comely kind of attire vpon her head, faire in face, ſober in countenance, lowly in gate, and yet moſt louely to behold. In her hand ſhe had a Bowe which bent when ſhe pleaſed, and ſeuen arrowes, well headed and ſharpe, and though ſhe were otherwiſe naked, not hauing other weapons at all, yet did
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15406:180"/>ſhe not ſtand in doubt of this fierce Monſter, but boldly marched towards him, whileſt though her pace was ſoft and humble, yet did it ſeeme this hugie beaſt did feare her, and faine would haue bene gone from her.</p>
               <p>Diuers were our opinions as concerning this Dame, ſome thought ſhe was <hi>Diana,</hi> others that it was <hi>Iune,</hi> ſome <hi>Minerna,</hi> and ſome <hi>Venus.</hi> But to ſay truth, ſhe reſembled none of them, being more faire, then ſome of them, and leſſe beautifull then the other: and yet more milde and curteous then any of them all.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we all agreed, with a generall conſent, that ſhe was ſome diuine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeeing ſhe addreſſed her ſelfe to goe againſt the Monſter ſo boldly, who perceiuing her to approach towards him, turned towards her, vomitting forth ſo great and flaſhing a flame, as all ſeemed to be on fire thereabouts, we thinking that ſhe had bene conſumed with the ſame.</p>
               <p>But as gold taken out of the burning Furnace,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> is farre more bright and fierce, then when it was firſt flung in, and as Camomill, the more it is trod vpon, the thicke and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it groweth: euen ſo, might we ſee this faire Archereſh to ſhew more cleare and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when the flame was once paſt and gone then ſhe had bene before.</p>
               <p>No hurt had ſhe at all, which made vs to wonder, whileſt putting one of her arrowes into her Bowe, ſhe aimed ſo right, as ſhe planted it within one of the eyes of this monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous beaſt, who for very rage and madnes, caſt forth a moſt horrible roaring, mingled with fire, blood, &amp; frothy fome; whereupon, he flieth vp into the aire, thinking to come downe with great violence vpon her, and ſo to gripe her within his Tallents, but ſhe quickly ſhot another ſhaft into his bellie, as he was about to flie vpon her, who ſlipping a little aſide, ſuffered him to fall with great force vpon the hard ground.</p>
               <p>This made him to leape vp haſtily againe, and with ſtrange furie to run towards his enemie to deuour her, who neuer gaue backe one foore for the matter, but quickly let fliean other arrow, which lighted iuſt vpon one of his eares, which made him ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious through very griefe and paine, as he flew vpon her with great violence, and with his ſharpe pawes (in deſpite of her) ſnatcht her Bowe &amp; Arrowes from her: which done, away he runneth with them through the wood, leauing the flight, and the faire Virgin, that followed after him. I ſeeing this, made all the haſt I could to get downe, to the end I might know what ſhe was, and thereupon followed her hard.</p>
               <p>Hauing ouertaken her, I was giuen to vnderſtand by her, that this Monſter was PRIDE, hauing the head of a wilde Boore, proud &amp; greediet: he skinne, the haire, and the colour, of a roaring Lyon, ſtately and high minded, more then other beaſts: the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of a mutinous Leopard, wonderfull inſolent, the clawes of a Griffon, by nature arrogant.</p>

               <p>All Chriſtians (for the moſt part) were in the ſame predicament, eſpecially ſuch, who tearme themſelues to be Maiſters of the Lawe, and teach the ſame: for ſo ſweet a thing is glorie, as euery one deſireth, and runneth to haue it.</p>
               <p>But (as I told you before) our Sauiour Chriſt, being borne in an old rotten ſtable, within a Manger vpon haie, and betwixt two harmeleſſe beaſts, chaſed away this cruell Monſter, vnto the ſhame of all other mortall creatures.

               <p>Of the number of ſuch as haue bene patient, was that graue <hi>Camillus,</hi> who being

               <p>And therefore thriſe wiſe was that Phyloſopher, that thought nothing in this world to be worſe then the tongue, becauſe it not onely bringeth calamitie vnto him that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, but alſo vnto the whole common-wealth beſides.</p>
               <p>And therefore, well ſaid that old Sage of <hi>Greece,</hi> who affirmed, that ſilence was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and without blame, whereas ſpeaking, was ſubiect vnto reprehention and reproach.</p>
               <p>The auncient wiſe men in times paſt, did offer Sacrifice vnto dumb <hi>Silence,</hi> as vnto a ſacred Deitie, adoring her with great reuerence, for many a one haue bene cut ſhort of their liues, becauſe of their ouer-raſh and bold ſpeech: and this found I, to be but too true, by mine owne experience, and vnto my no ſmall griefe.</p>
               <p>Well, I not finding my Miſtris there, went ſeeking of her vp and downe, not making account of any paine, ſo I might once haue a ſight of her, loue making that labour, to ſeeme but eaſie and ſweet, which Louers vndertake, when they follow in purſuit their faire and beautious Ladies, for the deſire which they haue to ſee them, maketh them to thinke it is no trauaile at all, and that man thinketh that he rather plaieth then worketh, who expecteth ſome worthie recompence when he hath brought his worke vnto an end.</p>
               <p>This made me to run vp and downe to ſee if I could finde her, whileſt being earneſt in this buſines, I might heare a certaine voice comming forth of a thicke quickſet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I ſtaied awhile to harken if it were hers or no, but I knew quickly it was not, as ſoone as I hard the Song, which was as followeth.</p>

               <p>Thus was the Shepheard (amorous of my <hi>Diana</hi>) of whome I told you before, who reaped no more ſweet fruits of his loue, nor found any more curteſie at her hands, then I had done, which was in effect nothing, ſo that we being borne (both) vnder one Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, became to become partners and companions in our loue and miſerie together. He ſighed and ſobbed as I did, he wailed and wept as I vſed to doe, and yet neither his ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor his teares, were any more profitable vnto him then they were vnto me.</p>
               <p>After his Song was finiſhed, he began thus afreſh to complaine. O <hi>Cupid,</hi> how well haue the Gods choſen thee to be the bloodie butcher of their cruelties, ſince they could not beſtowe this office vpon any that could diſcharge the place ſo well as thou, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou art more cruellie giuen, then any one that is in heauen aboue, or elſe in hell belowe?</p>
               <p>There is no tortor or torment, no Corſie or anquiſh, of what Nature or kinde ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is without hope, Loue onely excepted: for to miſerable Captaines, there is ſome hope of their freedome, to poore and beggerly wretches, a conceit to become rich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: &amp; to ſicke perſons, ſome comfort to recouer their former health; but loue is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all likelihood or beliefe of hope whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Who then is more cruell then he, who more to be doubted, and who ſo hurtfull and dammageable vnto mankinde? and therefore when the Gods meane to puniſh vs moſt cruellie, then doe they ſend this cruell executioner vnto vs, he being farre worſe then the flaſhing lightning it ſelfe, for that (without languiſhing) quickly diſpatcheth vs, where this, after it once beginneth with vs, neuer maketh an end, driuing vs to linger in a worſe then deadly conſumption.</p>
               <p>Too well finde I this, and feele it to my ſmart, louing in diſpaire, and yet in ſuch ſort, as death, which is hatefull vnto men (and is of force to rid me out of this agonie and inſupportable paſſions) is forbidden me, I not daring to die, for feare to looſe the wiſht for preſence of her who daily killeth me.</p>
               <p>So doth the Marchant allured with profit, ſcowre ſo often the ſwelling Seas, that in the end, both he and his ſhip, with all his Marchandiſe is ſwallowed therein.</p>
               <p>And ſo I loue, and yet will not giue ouer that which in the end will drowne me, and be the cauſe of my pittious ouerthrow: but as the Gods harden the harts of ſuch men whom they meane to chaſtiſe, who when it is too late begin to thinke how they might haue aunided the ſame, ſo the more rigorouſly to puniſh me, the heauens haue forced me to loue, depriuing me of all meanes how to helpe my ſelfe, becauſe they are deſirous of my fall.</p>

               <p>And now ſhe had quite forgotten the foreſaid Monſter, and her feare was paſt and gone, when no ſooner ſhe eſpied me, but that her colour began to change, ſhe ſhewing not that liuelines in the Galliard, as ſhe had done before, for my preſence brought the danger before her eyes, which ſhe had but lately ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Being thus troubled in minde with two contrarie opinions, I thought it beſt to ſtay, vntill they had made an end of their paſtime, the better to be reſolued therein, being greatly moued, in that vpon my firſt arriuall, I ſawe her change her countenance, and therefore longed the more to know the cauſe thereof.</p>

               <p>The Dance ended, my Ladie came ſtraight towards mee, demanding, and enquiring of me, what that Monſter and that Maide were, and what became of them?

               <p>Let vs not therefore vaunt our ſelues ouermuch, leaſt wee be taken downe ſooner then we looke for: for hee onely that is lowly in minde, ſhall be accounted of. Let vs then ſhunne all <hi>Prids:</hi> to auoyd the ſame, we muſt leaue all companies, all Cities, and all Courts of Princes.</p>
               <p>So did the deuout and mortified <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> leaue the world, retiring her ſelfe into a Rock,<note place="margin">The death of M.

               <p>To leaue this Monſter, the Auncient good Fathers, ranne into Woods and Deſarts, leauing their Townes and Cities, as <hi>Paul, Anthony, Hierome,</hi> and diuers moe, becauſe <hi>Prsde</hi> ſeldome or neuer haunteth ſolitarie places, for feare he ſhould be ſtarued for hun, ger, (but rather runneth amongſt the Rich, and where there is good ſtore, and plentie of euery thing, and thither likewiſe muſt wee withdraw our ſelues, if wee meane to liue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutlie indeed.</p>

               <p>O thrice happie they, who giuing ouer the world, paſſe the reſt of their liues in true holineſſe and vertue, in ſome ſecrete and remote place, as if it were an Hermitage, where neither Ambition, nor Enuie, neither Couetouſnes, nor vaine Loue, trouble them not at all, whilſt they with great contentment and pleaſure, paſſe the reſt of their liues, free from all daungers whatfoeuer.</p>
               <p>There they grieue not to ſee their enemies waxe rich, and themſelues to growe poore.

               <p>Hence then all Ambitious creatures, for I muſt needes leaue you, ſince you ſoyle our ſoules, as oyle doth ſtaine a garment.

               <p>And therfore here I proteſt, that from hence forward, I will leaue this wicked world, and that moſt willingly, with all the vaine pompes, and flattering greatneſſe of the ſame, wiſhing euery one that is wiſe to followe mee, taking the ſame courſe I am in hand to doe.</p>
               <p>So horrible and terrible is the fouleneſſe of that Beaſt, as it maketh me (yet) to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for verie feare, and neuer ſhall I thinke thereof, but that I ſhall finde my ſelfe the worſe a long time after: Therefore to preuent the worſt, and not to fall into his gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping pawes, I am reſolued to forſake all companie of men, ſhutting my ſelfe within ſome vncoth and vnfrequented place, like vnto a <hi>Recluſe,</hi> where without euer ſeeing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15406:185"/>any bodie, I will end the remnant of this my too long life, farre from <hi>Pride</hi> and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and voyd of all loue and enuie.</p>
               <p>This is my conſtant and certaine reſolution, which I propoſe to ſuch as (minding to follow me) are willing to be partakers of true <hi>Humslitie,</hi> gaining thereby reſt in this world, and in the world to come peace euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>Therefore (my deare and ſweet companions) although I be loth, yet muſt I needs leaue you, to ſeeke out this rough and auſtere kinde of abode, where my drerie eyes ſhall be exempted from the view of this ſtrange Monſter, which would make me to die for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feare onely, if they ſhould by chance once more haue neuer ſo little ſight of him: yea, yea, I will ſeeke to auoide his loathed prefence by this good meanes, whileſt following the ſteps of humble <hi>Humilitie,</hi> I ſhall imitate that great veſſell of election, who reioyced in nothing ſo much, as in the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That religious S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who called himſelfe, the voice of a cryer in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, and that godly <hi>Elias,</hi> who tearmed himſelfe to be a feather blowne vp and downe by the winde, all which three, were lowly and humble aduerſries to <hi>Pride,</hi> and voide of all ambition.</p>
               <p>Therefore haue I ſet vp my reſt to caſt Anker in this Hauen, after my ſayling through ſo many and dangerous mortall Seas, deſiring you all (my deare and louing ſiſters) moſt humble entreating you, that none of you doe me that great wrong, as to ſeeke to dehort me from this ſo holy a reſolution, which if you ſhould, yet were it but in vaine, and to no purpoſe at all: he is accurſed, that ſeekes to leade aſtray that ſinner, who is entered into the path of his ſaluation, he hauing a ſorrowfull heart, and being penitent in his minde for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now (reuerend Sire) iudge you if this Oration was pleaſing vnto me or no, I ſtood mute and ſtill, as that huge Gretian Horſe made of wood, wherein were hidden the enemies of <hi>Troy,</hi> for neuer (vntill then) did I feele the piereing darts of ſorrow aright.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of this, all my other paines were but pleaſures, nay meere toyes (to ſpeake of) in a manner, compared vnto this Corfie, which ſo violently ſeazed vpon me, as I felt moſt bloodie pangs, and cruell conflicts to make warre within me, the anguiſh thereof being ſo inſupportable, as I looked euery houre when my ſoule and bodie ſhould haue parted aſunder. Ah moſt vnluckie tongue, who taught thee to talke ſo much?</p>
               <p>Alas, that man ſhould be ſo vnwife, as to make way vnto his owne ouerthrow, whileſt he thinking to doe for the beſt, it falleth out vnto him for the worſt, and where he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to haue praiſe, there oftentimes he purchaſeth moſt blame and diſcredit. Full little did I thinke, but that whileſt I reported the filthines of the Monſter, ſhe would haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me great thankes for the ſame, and that made me with the beſt tearmes I could, to ſet out my tale, but it fell out quite contrarie, for I ſeeking to get ſomewhat, loſt all. Well doe I ſee, that the prudencie of man is nothing, whileſt God ſcoſteth at their wiſedome, changing their diſſignes, quite contrarie vnto their deſire.</p>
               <p>Great reaſon had I to curſe that luckleſſe Monſter, vnto the bottomleſſe pit of hell, although (before) I had praiſed him ſo much, becauſe through him I was permitted to touch the faire hand of my froward Miſtris.</p>
               <p>And thus Louers, either hate or loue, what their blind God putteth into their heads, they being ſtill wauering and inconſtant in their opinions.</p>
               <p>Diuers were the heauie thoughts, which as then ſeazed vpon me, I being growne (in a manner) to follow blacke diſpaire, becauſe I ſawe I was like to be depriued of the preſence of my Ladie for euer, if ſhe (going onward as ſhe began) would ſeclude her ſelfe from all companies, like vnto an Ankreſſe. An other while, I imagined that I my ſelfe was culpable of all this wofull miſchance, fearing ſhroadly, that all ſuch as ſhould deplore or lament the loſſe of her, would lay all the fault vpon me. And therefore had I great reaſon to mourne and ſorrow as I did, I ſhewing by many ſignes, and expreſſing by diuers waies, how my feeble heart was wounded, with an incurable fore.</p>
               <p>But whileſt I ſtood (thus) ſighing, and lamenting vnto my ſelfe, and whileſt all the ſad Nymphs had fixed their weeping eyes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, not knowing what to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpeech which their Ladie made, the Shepheard who was amorous of her, arriued

               <p>O Shepheard, Shepheard, if as (now) our firſt Grandmother <hi>Eue</hi> liued, ſo farre would ſhe be from looking for honour and reuerend duetie to be done vnto her, as ſhe would doe nothing but weepe continually, whileſt her haire (with which we ſet out and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our faces) ſhould ſerue her to doe nothing elſe, then drie and weepe thoſe drerie teares of hers.</p>

               <p>This is the courſe I meane to take, from which before I will be turned, I will endure the torments and tortors of any cruell death whatſoeuer. O how bitter a Pill was this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſtomacke, and what anguiſh and ſorrow did the other Shepheard conceiue in his minde, when he hard this irreuocable ſentence of his vtter vndoing pronounced by her.</p>
               <p>He ſtood confounded and amazed, as <hi>Diomede</hi> the Greeke did, when fighting with braue <hi>Hector,</hi> he might ſee the lightning of heauen to fall before his eyes. His ſpeech failed him, his tongue faltered in his mouth, and being aſhamed to ſee he had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, he knew not what to ſay.</p>
               <p>And no meruaile, for the worthieſt Phyloſophers in the world, haue become mute, before meaner perſons then ſhe, witneſſe <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> with diuers others. And now I found my ſelfe depriued of all hope to deſcribe the rare vertues of my Miſtris, ſeeing ſhe ſo conſtantly refuſed the praiſes which (and but of right) was attributed vnto her: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I eſteemed my ſelfe rather the more vnfortunate, becauſe I had but onely this one way to ſhew my loyall minde vnto her, of which when I was hindered, I felt my ſelfe to die, a more then languiſhing death.</p>
               <p>As that meſſenger, who perceiuing his Maiſter to be angry with him, preſenteth
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15406:187"/>him with ſome pretie gift or other, hoping thereby to pacifie &amp; appeaſe his choller, but when he ſeeth that he reiecteth the ſame, he falleth preſently into diſpaire, and dieth for very grieſe and anguiſh of minde: Euen ſo I, when I ſawe a counter-maund, whereby I was forbidden to blazon forth the rare parts, &amp; matchleſſe qualities of my Miſtris, I became as one ſenceleſſe, through pure ſorrow of the ſame, becauſe I was barred of my will in that which I ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>Long time did I ſtand like a dumb Image or Idoll, whilſt I perceiued, that none durſt controll the proceeding of vnkinde <hi>Diana,</hi> ſo wiſe and prudent, did euery one hold her: and in the meane time, the other Nymphs, did as the followers of that wiſe Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, who neuer gaue any other reaſon for the opinions which they held, but this; <hi>Ipſe Dixit.</hi>

               <p>A liuely apprehenſion of a moſt paſſionate and ſudden ſorrow hindered my ſpeech, ſo as I could not anſwere as I might; confuting her former reſolution, with moſt liuely and apparant reaſons. It is eaſie for poyſon that is entered into a mans bodie, to worke as it liſt, vrging him to his end, if no remedie be ſought to reſiſt the ſame: Euen ſo, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of my Miſtris (not being refelled) whereby ſhe might be perſwaded to giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, made her to continue the more firme and reſolute therein.</p>
               <p>And now faine would I haue ſpoken, although (before) I wiſhed I had neuer ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my mouth, but I durſt not, for feare of offending her whom I coueted to pleaſe more then my ſelfe. Euery one of the Nymphs (without daring as much as once to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie againſt <hi>Diana</hi>) ſtood ſtone ſtill, holding downe their head s, as if they allowed of her proceedings; which was the matter, that the more afflicted me, I thinking that they were of the ſelfeſame conceit, and that they had perſwaded her firſt, to leaue and giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the world: yet if I might haue had but that libertie as but now and then to haue ſeene her in her ſolitarie Receptacle or Cell, I wold not haue cared halfe ſo much: but that was impoſſible, for I knew none but women might come there (all men being baniſhed from that place) as they were from thoſe ſacrifices, which the Romane dames vſed to ſolemnize and offer ſecretly and in the night, vnto the Goddeſſe. <hi>Bona Dea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the reaſons that made me ſo ſad, and theſe the occaſions, that wrought me ſuch ſorrow, yet in the end may heart was ſo great, and I longed ſo much to ſpeake, to ſee if I could dehort her from her former determination, as griefe forced me to burſt out yet with a wofull geſture and a heauie looke, in this manner. Moſt ſage and prudent Nymph, God hath not forbid vs to honour thoſe that be his creatures, but rather the more to induee vs to doe the more reuerence vnto them, calleth them Gods, for the glorie that others giue vnto them, returneth backe vnto him againe.</p>
               <p>That King, whom his Subiects obey, doth not hinder, neither is he angry that they beare reſpect vnto his Leftenants, becauſe the ſame dutie reboundeth backe againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him who is their Soueraigne, and for that without him, no ſuch reuerence ſhould be done. He hath promiſed vnto thoſe that are his children, that they ſhall ſit as Iudges vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne at the laſt day, to iudge the twelue Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Is he then iealous, if mortall men be honoured? No doubt he is not. For if this were true, then would he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue giuen them ſo great power (as he hath done) here in this world, neither haue ſet them in the place of his owne authoritie and gouernment, wherein they are inſtalled, becauſe he knew well, that they had neuer bene able to execute their office, nor to haue done ſuch miracles as he ſuffered them to doe, vnleſſe they had bene honoured and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by them. Therefore is he not angrie, that good men are highly accounted of, but rather puniſheth ſuch as will not be obedient and dutifull vnto them, as he did the Iewes who mocked and deſpiſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> who praying to him for them, he made this anſwere. <hi>Nogro, it is not thou, whom they haue deſpiſed, but mine owne felfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which we may gather, he will haue his elect to be reſpected. Wherefore (moſt gratious Nymph) if that great and euerlaſting God, to ſerue him here belowe vpon the earth, hath raigned downe vpon thee thouſands of goodly and beautifull vertues, being willing thou ſhouldeſt be honoured and eſteemed of euery one, why then ſhouldeſt thou refuſe ſuch fauours offered vnto thee? <hi>Iudith</hi> after ſhe had ouercome cruell <hi>Holofor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:15406:188"/>and deliuered her countrie from tyrannie and Bondage, refuſed not the honours which were done vnto her, knowing that glorie is the daughter of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and that the one can neuer be parted from the other.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, let vs humbly beſeech thee, to accept in good part our ſmall praiſes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confeſſe farre vnworthy for thee) ſeeing they are all we can beſtowe vpon thee, for ſo doing, thou ſhalt not fall into ſuſpition of <hi>Pride,</hi> as long as thou doeſt but what is the pleaſure of God, whoſe minde was, that ſome creatures ſhould be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then other ſome, to the end he would haue himſelfe glorified by them, and becauſe they ſhould be more admired and wondered at, then the reſt.</p>
               <p>In which number, you (faire Ladie) may place your ſelfe, for you were formed and made, that the wonderfull workemanſhip of the Eternall <hi>Iehouah</hi> might be the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired: and therefore you haue no reaſon to hinder that honour which is done vnto him through your meanes, he himſelfe ſpeaking of the worthines of his Elect, ſaith thus. <hi>If any one ſhall follow and administer vnto me, my father who liueth in the heauens, ſhall honour him againe.</hi> If God himſelfe diſdaineth not to doe honour vnto thoſe that are his, who dare (then) oppoſe himſelfe againſt that which he commandeth vs?</p>
               <p>Ought not we to imitate the Eternall Father, who is the Author of all wiſedome, in doing of which, we muſt as he hath taught vs, giue reuerence and reſpect vnto the iuſt and beſt worthy, who are not to refuſe it, ſeeing it proceedeth from his diuine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>

               <p>And whereas you condemne and diſdaine both Orators and Poets, yet haue there bene many of them that haue not done good vnto their priuate friends onely, but alſo vnto their whole countrie and common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">A praiſe of Cicero.</note> that famous Orator of <hi>Rome,</hi> did he not preſerue his citie through his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Eloquence, from being vtterly ſpoyled and ouerthrowne, when <hi>Cateline, Cethegus, Lentulus,</hi> with diuers other of their complices, had conſpired together, firſt to cut the throates of the chiefe Citizens, and then to ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire; he alone bringing to paſſe through his prudent policie, that which the braueſt Romane Captaine amongſt them would neuer haue effected, without the effuſion of blood, of millions of Citizens?</p>
               <p>Therefore did <hi>Cicero</hi> ſhew himſelfe more ſtout and more profitable, then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Commanders and braueſt Souldiours of them all,<note place="margin">Cicero preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Rome from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides this notable exployt of his, how often hath he ſaued many a good Citizen, and worthy Gentlemen from death, as that <hi>Roſcius,</hi> moſt vniuſtly accuſed before the Tyrant <hi>Scilly, Ligarius,</hi> and <hi>Deioterus,</hi> with many more, all which (through his diuine Eloquence) he reſtored vnto life: yea, he did more then all this; for he rather choſe to goe into voluntarie exile, then to encounter and withſtand the force of his vniuſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (although he might very eaſily haue done the ſame) and ſo by that meanes ſaued <hi>Rome,</hi> which otherwiſe was readie to take his part (if ſo he had pleaſed) he hauing the maior part of the greateſt perſons, and in a manner the whole youth of <hi>Rome</hi> to be on his ſide.</p>
               <p>Many other good deeds did this worthy man, leauing diuers learned peeces of workes behind him, to the no ſmall profite and benefit of that royall citie.</p>
               <p>Where you blame <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A praiſe of Homer.</note> you doe that which neuer any in the world hath done before, for ſo highly was he accounted of, as there were diuers goodly cities, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at debate and contention amongſt themſelues, committed their whole buſines vnto his iudgement, they receiuing for an irreuocable Sentence, but onely one of his verſes, and after he was dead, they fell out, and ſtriued, who ſhould haue his bodie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre the ſame. He is counted the Author of all Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>But ſay he ſhould (ſometimes) ſpare the truth now and then in his writings (as if he ſeemed to be a little partiall) yet was he neuertheleſſe to be borne withall, and could doe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15406:188"/>no otherwiſe then hee did, in ſpeaking (ſomewhat) in the praiſe and commendation of his owne Countrey: For, for our Countrey we are borne, and are bound to doe more for it, then for our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Againe, you muſt conſider, he was a Poet, and no Hyſtoriographer, and that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets haue more libertie, to write according vnto their owne fancie or affection, then Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers haue, who (without great reproach) cannot abuſe ſacred Veritie it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer it is, the workes of <hi>Homer,</hi> are full of iudgement and Learning, from whence, as from a deepe Fountaine, euery great Scholler draweth forth his learning, and without his books, groſſe Ignorance had darkned the whole world with her blacke gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie Cloudes.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Virgil,</hi> how could he doe leſſe, than what he did, ſeeing he did but praiſe ſuch, from whom hee had receiued ſo many benefites, and good turnes, and who had reſtored him, vnto his former liuing and Lands, all which he (before) had loſt? The vngratefull man is as bad, and as worthy to be puniſhed, as is the Homicide.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is better (now and then) to ſtraine curteſie with Truth, then to murther a man, for there may be amends made for a lie, but not for ones life, when it is gone, and taken away.</p>
               <p>And therefore that great <hi>Mantua</hi> Poet, is more to be excuſed, in that he ſomewhat diſſembled the veritie of the ſtorie, which he wrote, praiſing his benefactors, becauſe he would not be vnthankfull vnto them, then, if hee had ſpoken the Truth, and ſo concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe great kindneſſes which hee had receiued, whereby hee ſhould be taxed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
               <p>But for all this, he is reputed for the Prince of <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, his <hi>Aeneidos</hi> ſhewing to be a moſt learned and beautifull worke, in ſo much as he dying (before he had ſufficient time to make a finall ende thereof, eſpecially of thoſe verſes which hee left vnperfect) <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, would not permit that anie of his owne Poets ſhould take the ſame in hand to correct it. Being loth that ſo famous a Poeme ſhould be iniuried any way, hee chuſing rather to leaue it vnfiniſhed, as he found it, then that it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the hand of any other. Not vnlike that picture, which excellent <hi>Zeuxis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to make for <hi>Venus,</hi> no Painter daring (after his death) to take vpon him to ende the ſame.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Contrary vnto your minde, was <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who made ſo great account of <hi>Homers</hi> verſe, as he had alwayes his <hi>Iliades</hi> vnder the pillow of his bedde, lying hard by his ſword, affirming oftentimes, <hi>Achilles</hi> to be moſt fortunate, becauſe he was renowmed by ſo famous a Poet, wiſhing that hee had bene as then aliue, to the end hee might haue graced him ſo much, as to haue ſet forth his valiant exploits.</p>
               <p>Where you alledge <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> to haue made the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to wage battell together; I anſwere you, that hee could doe no leſſe, then perſwade his Countrey-men to defend the libertie of their Countrey, it beeing the greateſt Treaſure that free people eſteemed, eſpecially the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who continually were vp in Armes, to conſerue their auncient Liberties.</p>
               <p>In ſo much, as it is reported of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> that if hee had had as much force, power, and vallour, as he had of good affection, and true zeale towards his Countrey, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had neuer conquered <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he cannot be blamed, who fighteth vntill the laſt gaſpe of life, dying with the firſt and chiefeſt, for the health of his Countrey: as did that ſtout Orator, who loſt his life for that cauſe, hauing done many good ſeruices, and brought much profite vnto the

               <p>Thus doe you ſee, that whom you haue diſliked, the greateſt Monarks in the world haue accounted of, and ſo ſhould you doe (moſt beautifull Virgin) if you did well. But leaſt reaſon of all haue you to be of opinion to leaue this Actiue life, for to followe the Contemplatiue; becauſe hee that laboureth moſt, is worthie of the greateſt hire: hee that aduentureth moſt dangerouſlie, deſerueth moſt praiſe: and hee that effecteth, and bringeth to a good ende, a worke more admirable, and more excellent, then others, doth merit greateſt reward and honour.</p>
               <p>Now in the Actiue life, there is more trauaile, more profite for our Countrey, and more labour in the ſame, which if it be ſo, then are they worthie of more guerdon, and commendation, that liue in this world, then ſuch (as retiring themſelues, to liue in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) onely profite themſelues.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt, the right Mirrour of Chriſtian vertue, tooke vpon him this courſe of life: liuing, conuerſing, and dwelling amongſt men, without withdrawing himſelfe altogether into the Wildernes, to the ende hee might be profitable vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely.</p>
               <p>After him followed his Apoſtles, who gaue not ouer the world, to ſeeke ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth place of dwelling, to liue priuately vnto themſelues: But rather choſe to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the face of the world, where they laboured, trauailed, ſweat, and ſuffered much affliction for others, and not for themſelues.</p>
               <p>God will not haue that anie ſhould hide his Talent vnder the ground, (and ſo put it to no vſe) ſeeing he hath lent it him, for the publike commoditie of all men. Neither will hee, that a Lampe be hidden vnder a buſhell, vnto no ende, but rather that it ſhall giue light abroad. For in what doeth that man ſtand in ſteed of, (who fearing to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the publike good) ſeeketh onely to profite himſelfe?</p>
               <p>If euery one were of your opinion, what Magiſtrates, what Gouernours, or what Officers, ſhould wee haue to rule and gouerne Common-wealths? For ſo none would willingly take vpon him the buſines of his Countrey, remembring the troubles belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto the ſame, but rather withdraw themſelues from thence, to liue quietly, and at their owne contentment. But the Lawes both of God and man, forbid ſuch kinde of dealings. For they will, that ſuch, whome God hath made ſufficient and fit for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, ſhall ſerue the ſame: yea, though againſt his will, and not liue idlely, at his owne pleaſure, in as much, as it is not reaſonable, that the Maſter of a Shippe ſhall ſleepe and take his reſt, whilſt the Veſſell is toſſed with the ſtorme and Tempeſt vpon the Sea, and the paſſengers therein, ſtand in danger to be drowned.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, it is a moſt vniuſt thing, that the buſines of the Weale publike, and thoſe that may profite them by their vertue, ſhould liue quiet and at eaſe, without doing anie thing at all, but lie at pleaſure, in ſome one odde corner or another, priuately vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and the rather, becauſe our Countrey (moſt iuſtlie) claimeth to haue intereſt in our bodies, and in our ſoules.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15406:189"/>certaine ſolitarie place, which hee had choſen to finiſh his life in, (hauing before inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſonne, that bloody <hi>Mahometh,</hi> in his Eſtate royall) to encounter with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Armie,) ſo much feared of thoſe Pagans, and which, (for that cauſe) craued the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of old <hi>Amurath</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>So you, (moſt louely Nymph) who by your prudent behauiour, are able to doe much good ſeruice vnto the Weale-publike, ought not to refuſe ſo honourable a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but rather be the more willinger, when you may doe good vnto your followers and friends. For what ſhall become of this goodly companie of Nymphes, which are committed vnto your charge and conduct, if you ſhall leaue them? They ſhalbe like vnto a faire flocke, that hath no Shepheard, and therefore in great daunger to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of rauenous Wolues.</p>
               <p>Chaunge then, chaunge I beſeech you, this your late conceited opinion, and if not for loue of your owneſelfe, yet at the leaſt doe it, in fauour of theſe ſweet Nymphes, who, without you, are moſt miſerable creatures, abandoned and giuen ouer vnto the rage of moſt vnfortunate miſhaps.</p>
               <p>Thus did I plead mine owne cauſe, euery one of the Nymphes commending and applauding my perſwaſions, being glad of my diſcourſe, and allowing of my ſpeeches, whilſt they all (with one conſent) made the ſame ſute vnto her, they themſelues beeing now become bolde, (ſince I had broken the yce before them) to deliuer in effect, as much vnto her, as I had done alreadie; And the more to moue her vnto pittie, no teares, nor ſighes were ſpared, no mournfull complaints forgotten, neither any pittious intreatings left vnremembred.</p>
               <p>After this followed a long narration of the dangers which her abſence was like to bring vnto them (after they had a little blamed her) firſt to take them as her charge and guide, and then to leaue them thus vpon the ſuddaine.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, there was nothing left vnſpoken, whereby ſhe might be diſſwaded,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> to giue ouer this her enterpriſe. But as an olde Beech tree, deepely rooted in the ground, being ſtrong and huge in growth, is not moued any thing at all, with the ſmall blaſtes of Sommer windes; and as the ſtubborne Rock that ſtandeth in the middeſt of the Sea, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtirreth for all the waues, that beate and flaſh againſt him: Euen ſo, my cruell Ladie, was not moued at all, although with teares, with cries, and with laments, we called ſtill vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, ſhee being reſolute in her firſt purpoſe and determination, affirming the heauens themſelues, not to be ſufficient to alter her minde.</p>
               <p>For (ſaid ſhee,) it is to thoſe (whom the ſoueraigne of all Kings, hath giuen force and power to ſerue their Common-wealths) you ſhould addreſſe your ſpeeches and not vnto me, who am but a poore ſilly Maide, who ſtand in no other ſtead, then to eate the fruites which proceed from the earth, &amp; who can no way be beneficiall vnto my Countrey, but only by my prayers, which I ſhall farre better deliuer and preſent before the diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, I being in ſome remote place, ſeparated and alone, then if I ſhould liue, where I ſhould behold the fond vanities of worldlings continually.</p>
               <p>As for you (my deare companions) a worſer guide then my ſelfe, Heauen neuer can beſtow vpon you. That Goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> whom you ſerue, ſhall take care of you, neither wil ſhe leaue you vnprouided of ſome one or other worthy protectreſſe, that may alwaies defend you. Should I haue ſtayed with you ſtill, (yet could not you haue hoped, that I could haue done any good for you, by reaſon of the ſmall power &amp; ability, which vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Fortune</hi> hath beſtowed vpon me. And yet I muſt needs confeſſe, that your abſence will be an exceeding corſie &amp; griefe vnto me, and that loſing you, I ſhall loſe the chiefeſt ſtay of my ioy &amp; contentment. But notwithſtanding all this, ſo ſweet and comfortable is the thought of ſpirituall things, as I muſt leaue all mortall pleaſures for them. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is my comfort, that the ſeparation of our bodies ſhall neuer part our former affection, which we haue borne one another. Then I beſeech you all, forget not me, as I will euer remember you. You ſhall haue parcell of my prayers, and I will thinke vpon you in my ſoule when I am alone. Weepe not then for her, who goeth away to lead a moſt bleſſed life: otherwiſe, I ſhall take you to be my mortall enemies, enuying my good fortune, neither bewaile her loſſe, who neuer could be halfe ſo profitable vnto you, whilſt ſhee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with you, as ſhee ſhall be, when ſhe is ſundred from you.</p>

               <p>Hauing made this ſorrowfull Song, I determined to preſent it vnto my Ladie, (come of it (whatſoeuer could) for my laſt farewell, that euer ſhe ſhould haue of mee; wherevpon I went to ſeeke her, and ſuch was my good fortune, as I found her all alone, walking vnder the ſhadow of a number of ſweet Cipreſſe trees.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had I a ſight of her, but that a certaine timerous reſpect, ioyned with a kinde of amazement, ſeazed vpon mee, ſo that I became vpon the ſuddaine, as colde as any Ice.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon I began to be aſtoniſht, quite forgetting my former reſolution, whilſt I remained as a Pillar fixed in the ground, not being abe to doe anie thing, but to gaze vpon her more then Angelicall face.</p>
               <p>My vitall ſpirits, were all flowen into mine eyes, who held them very earneſtlie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in contemplation of this her more then peerleſſe beautifull countenance.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I thus beheld her, I remembred the vnſupportable loſſe I was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, loſing her diuine preſence, knowing that the more I viewde her, the more was my griefe, when I thought I ſhould be depriued from her: and yet neuertheleſſe, I tooke a wonderfull great contentment, to loſe my ſelfe in this ſweete Riuer, as the flie doth, when hee is drowned in ſweete milke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minerua,</hi> neuer ſeemed more graue, nor fuller of maieſtie, vnto poore <hi>Arachne,</hi> (when ſhee was puniſhed by her) neither did <hi>Diana</hi> ſhewe more amiable or louely, when ſhe accompanied her Shepheard <hi>Endimion,</hi> then my Miſtris did in mine eye.</p>
               <p>Being thus rauiſhed with ſo heauenly a ſight, I could not withdraw my ſelfe from the ſame, deſiring no other death in my minde, but in beholding her, ſo to giue vp the Ghoſt, which the Virgin perceiuing, thus ſaluted mee.</p>
               <p>What is the matter (Shepheard) that you are vp ſo early this morning? what ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou here, and why lookeſt thou ſo ſadde and heauilie? Away with this dumpiſh melancholy, the butcher of mans life, for hee liueth not, but rather languiſheth, as one dying, who being ouer ſadde and heauie, cannot ſhake this penſiue humour from him.</p>
               <p>What (man) be of good courage, we muſt he ordered by the will of the Gods, and (without killing ourſelues, with theſe inward paſſions) muſt attend the good houre, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it ſhall pleaſe them to call vs: For neither weeping nor wailing can alter our Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, neither can they be mended thereby, becauſe it lieth not in our handes, but in the heauenly Powers, to amend what is amiſſe.</p>
               <p>This is my aduiſe, in that I wiſh thee well, for wee are giuen by nature, to wiſh well vnto thoſe whom we know are our friends and wel-willers, whereas otherwiſe we ſhould be worſe then bruit beaſts, who acknowledge curteſies which they haue receiued.</p>
               <p>Then take this counſell from mee, although I was borne rather to learne counſell, then to giue counſell vnto others. But the Gardiner ſometimes can giue good hearbes for Phiſicke, and a wiſe man now and then, may be aduiſed, by one that is ſimple and without learning: as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who tooke the opinion of his Father in law, being farre leſſe skilfull then hee.</p>

               <p>Muſt I be well in bodie, and yet deadly ſicke in minde? Muſt I be ſicke in minde, and yet not conſume away? And muſt I conſume away, and not yet die, but languiſh thus in horror, worſe then in hell, yea, and that continually?</p>
               <p>O vniuſt Heauens, ô too vnkinde and barbarous <hi>LOVE,</hi> what haue I done vnto thee <hi>Cupid,</hi> that for all my loyall loue, thou (thus) ſhouldeſt reward me.

               <p>Ah Miſtris, deare Miſtris, behold here before you, the moſt wretchedſt creature that euer liued vnder the Cope of heauen, the very Anatomie of miſerie, and the true Mirrour of all misfortunes: And belieue I beſeech you, that the terrours which euery minute of an houre, affright his inward ſoule, is farre worſe then vglie Death it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But iuſtly am I puniſhed, ſeeing (as ouer preſumptuous) I durſt be bolde to flie ſo high, like vnto another <hi>Phaeton,</hi> preſuming to adore your more then druine and ſacred Beauties.</p>
               <p>Yet (ſweet Ladie) pardon me, becauſe <hi>LOVE</hi> is the cauſe, who was aſſiſted by your faire eyes, to make me his baſe priſoner, and abiect bond ſlaue for euer: againſt whom, no force, neither heauenly, nor humane, is able to preuaile.</p>
               <p>Thus was I bolde to pleade like an earneſt ſuter for grace, vnto my Ladie, I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that I was neuer like to finde ſo fitte an occaſion againe, as then I had, becauſe I ſaw ſhe was reſolute to enter into a kinde of life, farre worſe, and harſher, then anie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall liuing whatſoeuer.

               <p>Thus you ſee how deſperate perſons ſometimes helpe themſelues, although quite contrarie vnto their owne expectation.</p>
               <p>So fought that ſicke and diſeaſed Souldier, being full of valour, vnder his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, king <hi>Antigonus,</hi> onely becauſe he would be ridde of his diſeaſe, which did ſo much afflict him; but no ſooner was hee cured thereof, then that he became a notable Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, as one that was deſirous to ſleepe in a whoſe skinne, and neuer after would venture in the warres againe.</p>
               <p>The faire Virgin, hearing mee thus earneſt, were it, either becauſe ſhee was loth to leaue behind her (ſhe being now readie to depart from vs) any cauſe to conceiue hardly of her, or whether it were that my pittifull ſpeeches had moued her vnto remorſe, and to

               <p>If thy diſeaſe <hi>(Arcas)</hi> be incurable, and that as thou thy ſelfe thinkeſt, it will hardly be healed, why then haſt thou bene ſo obſtinate, as thou wouldeſt not in time ſeeke what thou mighteſt to haue bene rid of the ſame?</p>
               <p>Very ſimple is he, who vndertaketh to tranſport a huge Rocke from one place to an other, when it is not by nature to be remoued.

               <p>True loue is of this nature, that it will neuer ſuffer any iniurie to be done, vnto that which it loueth, neither can it (rightly) be termed Loue, but rather furious rage, if it be cauſe of any ſuch wrong.</p>
               <p>But I pray thee tell me, what is it that thou wouldeſt haue of me? wouldeſt thou that in ſauing thee, I ſhould vtterly vndoe my ſelfe? or wouldeſt thou haue, that thy content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be built and founded, vpon the ruines of my diſcontentments, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? I cannot tell, neither know I what thy meaning is, and yet this good conceit haue I of thee, that I am perſwaded thou harboreſt no ſuch bad thought within thee, and therefore let me intreate thee, that thou wilt be content, ſince I grieue at thy diſtreſſe, and that I would moſt willingly eaſe thee of thy paine (if poſſible I could) ſo it did not ſtand with the loſſe of mine honour. Then if thou loueſt mee, I doe not thinke thou wouldeſt ſuffer me to endure ſuch an ineſtimable dammage.</p>
               <p>Conſider well of this matter, and thou ſhalt finde that I can no way pleaſure thee as thou deſireſt, and as I my ſelfe couet, vnleſſe I would ouerthrow my eſtate for euer.

                  </gap> my meaning with ſo great fauour: whereupon I preſumed to replie thus vpon the ſuddaine.</p>
               <p>Vertuous, and peerleſſe <hi>Diana:</hi> what teſtimonie haue I euer giuen you, and how haue I euer carried my ſelfe towards you, but that my Loue was alwaies chaſte and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt? If ſo, why then ſhould you now miſtruſt me?</p>
               <p>Alas, if I be now chaunged, (my miſeries being ſo wretched as they are, and that you thinke I am worſe then I haue bene) why then doe you not quickly pronounce the ſentence of Death againſt mee, without permitting me to liue any longer?</p>
               <p>No; no: my deſires were neuer others then thine. Neuer did I thinke to diſobey
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:15406:192"/>thy commandements, nor offer iniurie vnto thine vntainted honour, rather ſhall this bodie of mine be ſwallowed vp by wilde and ſauage beaſts; and thinke not (I beſeech you) otherwiſe of me, but that I would take reuenge vpon mine owne proper ſelfe, for your honours ſake, if through my default it ſhould happen to receiue the leaſt hurt or dammage that may be.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſhould I goe about but to croſſe thee in thy will, and not doe as thou biddeſt, I ſhould thinke the worſe of my ſelfe as long as life ſhall laſt; whileſt liuing ſo, I would commit it no life, but rather worſe then death it ſelfe. Sufficient enough, and too much am I pleaſed for my paines, enough am I recompenced for my trauailes, and am ſatisfied at the full, for all my labours paſt, ſeeing thou haſt ſo much vouchſafed to abaſe thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſelfe (in ſtriking a Saile ſo lowe) as to ſpeake to me ſo much thine inferiour. Onely this onely ſmall boone, let me intreate of thee, which by thy facred Vertue, by thy rate prudencie, by thy excellent wit, and by thine exquiſite beautie, I ſhall deſire thee not to denie, that is, to giue meleaue, to kiſſe thy faire and victorious hand, which ſhall content me as much as if I were <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole vniuerſall world, the remembrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall make the reſt of my daies to proue moſt happie and fortunate.</p>
               <p>Aduiſe you then, if this my prayer be iuſt and ciuill, which if it be ſo, then graunt me ſo much grace. But if not, thy will be fulfilled, thy pleaſure be done, and thy deſire be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht euery way. It is the firſt that euer I begd, and it ſhall be the laſt that euer I will craue.</p>
               <p>Thus did I boldly put forward my ſelfe, vrging my Miſtris with great vehemencie for the ſame, who ſtood ſtill ſtudying vpon the matter a while, whileſt ſhe bluſhed like the damaske Roſe in May: I in the meane time houered betweene hope and ſcare, halfe dead and halfe aliue, to heare what ſhe would anſwere, who in the end replied thus.</p>
               <p>Ah Shepheard, how eaſie a matter is it, to finde a ſmall thing, that may hurt much? and how quickly may we obtaine and purchaſe that, which hapneth moſt to our diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures afterward?</p>
               <p>This naturall appetite of ours, which inuiteth vs to deſire ſo many things, which we imagine to finde ſweet and pleaſing, paſſeth away as doth a flaſh of lightning in the aire, leauing vs neuer a whit the richer, nor the more contented then we were before.</p>
               <p>What profit doth that pleaſure bring vnto Louers, which they ſo earneſtly couet to enioy, but a moſt heauie and ſad repentance, when it is once gon and paſt? Things that are vertuous, ought to be deſired alone, becauſe they laſt, and not ſuch as are mortall, weake, and fraile, although they ſeeme ſweet at the firſt beginning.</p>
               <p>This which thou demandeſt of me, will doe thee no good, and though perhaps thou ſuppoſeſt thou ſhalt feele ſome ſhadow thereof, yet will it ſo ſoone vaniſh and be gone, as thou ſhalt not haue leiſure to haue ſo much as a true taſt thereof.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Arcas, Arcas,</hi> diddeſt thou but know, how much this honour is recommended vnto vs, what great care and heed there is giuen vnto vs, to accompanie it, and how much we are bound and obliged to looke: moſt narrowly and ſtraightly vnto the ſame, I verily belieue, thou wouldeſt not wiſh me that I ſhould breake the leaſt duetie belonging vnto the conſeruation thereof, not for all the liuing in the world.</p>
               <p>But perhaps thou wilt ſay, it is very true and yet I anſwere, that he that offendeth in any ſmall matter, is ſuſpected to be culpable of greater: and the firſt opening of a fault, is difficult vnto a vertuous minde, but very caſie, when he ſhall be permitted to take an habit in the ſame.</p>
               <p>For ſo ſmall a trifle, and ſuch a thing as can doe thee no good, be not (I beſeech thee) the cauſe that I be eſteemed or taken for other, then hithereto I haue bene: for hare and leane, ſhould that tryumph be, which thou ſhouldeſt purchaſe by mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, becauſe my blood ſhould preſently make ſatisfaction for the ſame. Content thee then, with what I haue ſaid, and thinke that I will not denie thee any thing, which may ſtand with my credit: but conſidering that this which thou requireſt, may ſome way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the ſame, I cannot iuſtly yeeld vnto thy demand. Leaue (then I ſay once more) to importune me for that, which will doe thee no good, yet will hurt me much, and then ſhall I thinke that thy ſpeeches are true, and that thy loue is chaſte and vertuous, as thou
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15406:192"/>haſt hitherto proteſted.</p>
               <p>This was my Ladies ſharpe replie, which draue away all my former ioy I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of hope, by reaſon of her firſt kinde words; ſo as now my complaints began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh againe, my teares renewed, and my ſighes came forth faſter then they had done before.</p>
               <p>I was ſo galled with ſorrow, and ſo much griped at the heart with this her vnexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deniall, as I could doe nothing but weepe, holding downe mine eyes towards the ground, as not daring to looke vpon her.</p>
               <p>In the end, ſurcharged and oppreſſed with contrarie paſſions, I burſt out into theſe wofull tearmes, hauing before ſent forth thouſands of ſcalding ſighes, as precurſors of the ſame. O cruell Loue, O miſerable Starres, iealous of my good, O diſmall day wherin I was borne, and more then thriſe accurſed life of mine, ſince I am more wretched then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whatſoeuer liuing.</p>
               <p>After much labour taking, and many a yeares ſayling, the Pilot at length arriueth vnto his Hauen, but I (Caitiffe that I am) finde no end of my torments: None giueth ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour vnto me, neither doth any as much (as a little) eaſe me, my ſicknes encreaſeth with the day, continueth all night long, and yet neuer amendeth.</p>
               <p>Alas, alas, why died not I at the firſt, when hauing offended you (my deareſt Ladie) you exild me from you louely preſence? Vnfortunate Shepheard that I was, to perſwade my ſelfe to liue, and hope the beſt, when I finde no cauſe but of diſpaire and death. Ah had I then taken that readie courſe, I had bene (now) free from theſe helliſh panges which euery minute oppreſſe my heart, and I had bene partaker of thoſe rare beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which the ſoules of happie Louers enioy for euer.</p>
               <p>Sacred and Religious <hi>Diana,</hi> ſince you adiudge me vnworthy of any ſmall fauour at your hands, and that without yeelding to agree vnto ſo little a matter, you are deſirous of my end, yet at the leaſt doe thus much for me, as to permit me to die (in leiu of all my troubles) before thy beautious face.</p>
               <p>This I beg at your hand, for default of that other curteſie which you iudge me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of: for although you haue denied me the firſt, yet I hope you will agree vnto the ſecod: otherwiſe I vow, after I haue a hundred thouſand times tearmed you by the name of Cruell, I will moſt deſperately lay violent hands vpon my ſelfe, crying out that you haue bene the cauſe of mine vntimely ouerthrow.</p>
               <p>Graunt me then one of my requeſts, the laſt of which you cannot well denie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it coſteth you nothing. What hurt can this be vnto you any way, but rather good, when you ſhall doe ſo charitable a deed vnto the common-wealth, as to permit him to die, who is vnprofitable vnto the ſame? Without licence from you, I neither may nor will take this bloodie courſe in hand, ſeeing I hold my life from you, and that you alone and none but you, haue puiſſance ouer me. Linger not then, to yeeld vnto my deſire, for if you thinke, that my trauailes paſt, haue merited any reward, you cannot better recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, then to graunt me death, which is the onely thing I couet, ſeeing I muſt be depriued of your cheerfull preſence, as one not worthy to enioy it.</p>
               <p>As the Hunter is amazed, hauing loſt the tracing of the Deare which he hunteth (his dogs being at a bay) knoweth not which way to goe, nor well what path to take, whileſt his Hounds barking vpon ſome dich ſide round about him, he ſtandeth muſing what to doe.</p>
               <p>Euen ſuch a one my Ladie ſeemed to be, ſhe ſeeing her ſelfe charged with two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie demaunds, both which ſhe iudged aduerſaries vnto her honour, which to take ſhe knoweth not well, and therefore ſtandeth ſtudying (as one ſad and penſiue) what to ſay vnto this matter.</p>
               <p>If ſhe ſhould giue me her hand to kiſſe, ſhe feareth leaſt I ſhould fooliſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wit, ſpeake ſomething that might diſcredit her: and if ſhe ſhould ſuffer me to die (ſhe being now readie to giue ouer the world, and to become (as it were) a Religious <hi>Nunne,</hi> ſhe doubted leaſt the world would ſay, ſhe had done it for griefe of me.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhe was vnwilling that I ſhould die, vnto whom (deſpite of her ſelfe) ſhe thought her ſelfe ſomewhat beholding, knowing that death was but a cold recompence, for ſo great loue as I had borne her. Much was ſhe perplexed in her minde about this
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15406:193"/>buſines, my hard fortune did ſomewhat ſoften her ſtonie heart: but then againe, the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of her honour did harden it as much, but had Loue had but ſome intereſt or power in her, ſhe had quickly brought theſe two contraries vnto an agreement: but alas, he then had not, neither is he like (euer) to haue. What ſhould ſhe doe in theſe two extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and how ſhould ſhe throughly ſatisfie and content her honour?</p>
               <p>One while ſhe putteth forth her hand for me to kiſſe, and then (vpon the ſuddaine) putteth it backe againe: one while ſhe is about to casſhire me with rough ſpeeches, and then againe, ſhe ſeemeth willing to yeeld vnto my requeſt: one while ſhe careth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I die, and then by and by ſhe cannot endure ſhe ſhould be counted ſo cruell. Meane ſpace, ſhe ſeeth me to raine whole riuers of teares, and to ſend forth blacke clouds of ſcalding ſighes, whileſt with a ſobbing heart I thus (once more) follow mine old ſute vnto her.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon (faire Goddeſſe) that you thus ſtand lingring through delaies, and not ſuffer this forſaken and abiect wretch to die?</p>
               <p>To what end doth he liue? which way can he profite his countrie? and what reaſon haue you to lament his deſtruction? Pronounce, pronounce thy faithfull ſentence quickly, for he attendeth for nothing elſe, to the end he may with a more braue courage wend his way, to put in practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Speake then, and giue our this muſing: when the Iudge ſitteth vpon the life or death of an offender, he ſtandeth not ſtudying vpon the ſame, but ſoone pronounceth his finall iudgement. Deliuer (then) my ſentence, as a fatall Oracle, without delaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer: for to what end is it to winne time, for that which cannot be auoided. Free and diſcharge my doubtfull ſoule, from farther care, and ſeeme not to enuie at the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which I am like to haue by laying violent hands vpon my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> ſeeing me looke ſo pale and gaſtly, began to be a little moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards me, whereupon ſhe thus anſwered.</p>
               <p>Ah Shepheard, why dealeſt thou ſo hardly with me? and why doeſt thou conſtraine me to doe that which is againſt my will? and why (to ſaue thy ſelfe doeſt thou ſeeke that I may periſh? Hard hap had I, to be borne vnder ſo vnluckie a Plannet, ſithence (inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto thy requeſt) I ſhall leaue vnto the world a bad opinion of my chaſte minde, and in reſuſing to yeeld vnto thee, I ſhall be counted the murtherer of thy life.</p>
               <p>Ah would to God that that day wherein I firſt ſawe thee, had bene the laſt houre that euer mine eyes had ſeene thee any more.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing there is no remedie in extremities, come what will, I will rather ingage mine owne life, then venture thine, and if it be my fortune to die for this fault, yet will I thinke to finde my death more ſweet vnto me, then if I had put thee to ſuffer the ſame, ſeeing thou haſt endured ſo much for my ſake onely.</p>
               <p>Take then this accurſed hand (accurſed becauſe of mine honour) and doe with it as thou ſhalt pleaſe, yet with this ſolemne proteſtation, that if this my curteſie, ſhall bring the leaſt ſuſpition or ſcandall of my good name and fame vnto me, the ſelfe ſame hand that hath bene the cauſe thereof, ſhall make amends by ſhedding the pureſt blood which is within this bodie. Whereupon ſhe preſented me her faire hand to kiſſe.</p>
               <p>But in this exploit, I behaued my ſelfe as that braue Cauailier, who doth ſweare to be the death of his enemie, whileſt he keepeth him cloſe and ſtandeth out againſt him; but no ſooner doth he ſubmit himſelfe vnto him, but that he receiueth him moſt curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, forgiuing all diſpleaſures that is paſt: Euen ſo plaid I, for holding this pretions pawne within my power, and perceiuing that it grieued my Miſtris to giue the ſame as ſhe did, I vtterly refuſed her kinde offer, reſoluing with my ſelfe, rather to languiſh ſtill like a miſerable creature, then to giue her the leaſt diſpleaſure that might be, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, I diſputed of this queſtion a good while, before I let her hand goe from me.</p>
               <p>One while the great delight which it preſented vnto mine eyes, longing ſore as a ſtarued man for foode to poſſeſſe this rich Iewell, preſſed me very much to take that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie occaſion, not vnlike vnto that man, who hauing not of long time eate any thing (&amp; finding a Table furniſhed with great ſtore of meate) falleth vnto his Victualls, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15406:193"/>for his life forbeare from eating that, though he would neuer ſo faine.</p>
               <p>An other while, the extreame Loue which I bare vnto my Ladie, compelling me to ſeeke and preferre the contentment of her, aboue mine owne quiet, oppoſed it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, counterchecking my deſire; And therefore well might ſhe perceiue how farre I was from ſeeking the purchaſe of her diſhonour, when I reſolued to endure millions of torments, before I would be an occaſion that ſhe ſhould grieue or be diſcontented any way at all.</p>
               <p>Hauing long time debated within my ſelfe about this matter, in the end I did as that prudent King of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who being almoſt dead for thirſt, cauſed all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to drinke their fills, he himſelfe refuſing to taſt as much as one drop of the water (although he ſat vpon the Fountaines ſide) to the end he might ſaue his people from ſeruile bondage: and ſo did I refuſe this worthy gift, ſeeing I ſawe how dearely my Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris accounted of the ſame; and therefore taking her by that faire hand, I ſaid thus vnto her. No, no (my ſacred Goddeſſe) neuer ſhall it be obiected as a foule reproach vnto wretched <hi>Arcas</hi> that he went about to force the vertuous <hi>Diana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Death ſhall be more agreeable vnto me then life, before I will conſtraine or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell thee to any thing, that is againſt thine owne will.</p>
               <p>Suffer me I pray thee to continue the ſame, as I am, and let neither the one nor the other of my requeſts be graunted: I will not offer to touch thy beautious hand, with my polluted lips, ſeeing I perceiue) thou thinkeſt that it will be ſome diſparagement vnto thee; neither will I die at all, ſeeing my death is not agreeable vnto thee, but rather liuing (as I doe) a moſt languiſhing life, I will ſtill attend thy laſt will &amp; pleaſure. Firſt ſhall my ſoule flie forth from out this bodie, rather ſhall my heart burſt in ſunder within my breſt, and ſooner ſhall this vitall breath of mine be ſtopped on the ſuddaine, before I will doe any thing, that ſhall any way miſlike thy minde. If I demaund ought that is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pardon me I beſeech you, ſeeing Loue is the cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>As for my ſelfe, I will meekely beare, and patiently endure my tedious troubles, and ſtill vexing corſies, without lodging any more ſuch two vnwelcome gueſts within me, as you ſhall diſlike of. Then O yee miſerable wretches, all you that ſometimes haue liued here vpon the earth; come, come, and rid your ſelues of all your cares, and lay them all vpon me, who am ble and of force to beare them. And now you my drearie eyes, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting let your teares be; my ſcalding ſighes, neuer giue ouer to ſmoake from out my breſt, whileſt thou my tongue ſhalt doe nothing elſe, but pitteouſly report thy heauie Martyrdomes.</p>
               <p>Alas, when will that houre come, wherein (after I haue ſufficiently wept and wailed, ſighed and ſobbed)! may depart this vaile of miſerie. Ah (Ladie) muſt mine eyes endure to behold thine abſence? and ſhall my tongue be able to bid thee farewell? No no, rather let mine eyes be blind for euer, and let my tongue neuer pronounce word more.</p>
               <p>Ah kinde death, gentle death, curteous death, if euer thou haſt brought ſuccour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ſorrowfull wight, then come and helpe me. Behold I call thee, heare how I cry vnto thee, nay more, I ſummon thee in Iuſtice to appeare.</p>
               <p>But is it poſſible that a ſolitarie place, ſhall ſeclude ſo ſweet a Saint from my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? and muſt I be faine (looſing the ſubſtance) to feed vpon the ſhadow? No it cannot be, I firſt muſt die, not being able to endure her abſence.</p>
               <p>Madam, your moſt wretched, and yet more loyall Seruant <hi>Arcas,</hi> cannot leaue your preſence, but he muſt (withall) leaue his owne life: he muſt die before your eyes, before he depart from you: and faine would he ſacrifice his heart vpon the Altar of your beautie, if he might haue but your good will and leaue.</p>
               <p>But I ſee it will not be, for I am yours and not mine owne, you may not be without me, and therefore I will follow you whereſoeuer you goe, and when I can goe no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then will I ſhorten my daies to end mine endleſſe ſorrowes. For many Louers haue there bene, leſſe faithfull then I am, and nothing ſo zealous in loue as my ſelfe, that haue finiſhed their liues when they were depriued of their louing dames: and ſhall not I be as fortunate as they, euery way as vertuous as they? eſpecially when I haue deſerued more then they haue? which when I haue done, I hope (gratious Virgin) your chaſte ſoule will doe no leſſe then teſtifie, what great reſpectand dutious affection I bare vnto you,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15406:194"/>vntill my lateſt gaſpe, hauing long ſerued you, and yet neuer had any reward at all.</p>
               <p>But what talke I of reward, when I deſire to die, were it onely for this thing in that I durſt preſume to loue you? and yet, it is not death that daunteth not at all, onely I grieue, becauſe I feare, I neuer ſhall finde ſo ſweet a face in the other world, with which I may delight me.</p>
               <p>But I am not the firſt Louer hath bene ſent away vnrewarded of his Miſtris, and yet too great hath my recompence bene, in that I haue had that great good hap, as to haue ſeene you whileſt I liued, and now I muſt looſe you, can I doe other then looſe my ſelfe? you goe your way, and thinke you, I ſhall ſtay behind? Ah then how much are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for I will die, yea I will die, although not by your commandement, yet becauſe I ſhall ſee you no more: and this I here proteſt, I am moſt reſolutely minded to doe, come whatſoeuer will thereof: meane ſpace, withdraw thy hand from me, which I deſire not to kiſſe, ſince tis with thy diſpleaſure: whileſt I liued I ſought to pleaſe thee, and now I die, I will not ſeeke to croſſe thee.</p>
               <p>Away then with this thy hand, too faire for me to touch, aſſuring thee that I am as much contented with thy good will, as if I had enuoyed the greateſt pleaſure in the world.</p>
               <p>Then once againe (I beſeech thee) let me alone, and trouble me no more, I bid the world adue, and take my laſt farewell of thee, for die I will, ſince tis the onely thing which I deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana,</hi> ſeeing me looke ſo gaſtly, began to be afraid of me, doubting leaſt I would preſently haue laid violent hands vpon my ſelfe, as I ſweare vnto you (reuerend father) I had done, but that I found her more tractable and more kinde, which was the cauſe, that after ſhe had many times ſighed (beholding me with a moſt pittifull and curteous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) and mourning (as it were to ſee me in ſo heauie a plight) ſhe ſpake thus mildly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Arcas,</hi> moſt faithfull <hi>Arcas,</hi> if thou wilt die for my ſake, there is no reaſon but I ſhould be miſerable for thee, to requite this thy great kindneſſe towards me. So will I be for thee, and ſuch a one doe I wiſh my ſelfe to be, as long as I ſhall liue.</p>
               <p>Say not then, that thou art the moſt miſerable wretch aliue, ſince <hi>Diana</hi> is a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of thy miſerable fortunes, who to haue regard vnto her honour, and for the loue ſhe beateth vnto thee, ſhall liue moſt miſerable all the reſt of her ſad life, being ſomewhat comforted in this onely, that ſhe cannot ſuffer for two more worthy ſubiects.</p>
               <p>As ſweet ſhall be my griefes, when I ſhall thinke of thee, as my ioy ſhall be, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing I remember thee not at all: I ſee it is the will of the Gods, that things ſhould thus fall out, and I will not be repugnant againſt the ſame: more proofes I haue not to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my good meaning vnto thee (being hindered through mine honour) in leiu where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will giue thee a taſt of the reſt, by my continuall Martyrdomes.</p>
               <p>Therefore I coniure thee by that chaſte Loue, thou haſt ſo long borne me, offer no violence vnto thy ſelfe, but ſtay the will of the heauens, for it may ſo fall out as (thou maiſt) perhaps (ſee me once more) before thou dieſt, and ſeeing the houre is now come (that without ſeeing me more) I muſt abſent my ſelfe from thee, I will not conceit mine affection from thee, for I know thou wilt not ſeeke thy profit by my hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Too well doe I know, and muſt needs acknowledge thy faithfull and infinite Loue towards me. If euer man hath bene worthy of a Ladies Loue, then it is thine owne ſelfe, therefore thinke that nothing in the world hath hindered me, to make requitall vnto thee, as full well thou haſt deſerued, but chaſte honour, and ſeeing I cannot doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let me increate thee, haue patience.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the aſſurance of my amitie, may comfort thee (ſeeing thou canſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any other conſolation at my hands) aſſure thy ſelfe I loue thee deerly, yea (deare <hi>Arcas</hi>) dearely doe I loue thee; and to giue a moſt plaine teſtimonie of the ſame, I will and command thee, vpon that power and authoritie which thou haſt giuen vnto me ouer thee, that thou kiſſe my hand as thou before deſireſt: and I pray thee moſt hartily, to belieue that I am wonderfull ſorie, becauſe I cannot giue thee a more ample ſigne of my Loue vnto thee: content thee then with this ſmall fauour of mine, and thinke it is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15406:194"/>greater then it is, becauſe it commeth from ſo willing a minde, (and from her) who wiſheth vnto thee more happineſſe, then ſhe doth vnto her owne ſelfe.</p>
               <p>O ſweete words, which as a luſhious kinde of poyſon, infected my ſoule with true ioy, although afterwards they coſt me dearely, I hauing bought them at too high a rate, and yet what could I now deſire more!</p>
               <p>But as the fall from an high Tree, is farre more daungerous, then from a lower: and as the afflictions of rich men ſpoyled of their goods, is farre more grieuous then thoſe of the poore, becauſe they neuer had any ſuch wealth to looſe.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, theſe delightfull ſpeeches wrought my miſeries to be farre more cruell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards vnto mee, then if my Ladie (neuer) had pronounced them. Yet did they mee great good (as then) in reſpect I enioyed her companie, and in that ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe ſo kinde vnto me. But alas, it was my Fortune, and not her fault, ſince none can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his hard deſtinie.</p>
               <p>Meane time, I being aſtoniſht and amazed (trembling like that wayfaring man, when he beholdeth a Snake, winding about his legge) tooke my Lady by the Lilly-white hand, going about (with great reuerence to kiſſe it) when a ſuddaine feare, comming freſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my head, that my <hi>Diana,</hi> would miſlike of the ſame, made me to forbeare a while.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I thus ſaid vnto her: Sweet Ladie, I beſeech you forbeare, and let mee after (my wonted manner) languiſh away ſecretly in my ſorrowes, rather then any diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould trouble you at all. For too great a plague would that be vnto me, if I ſhould liue to behold the ouerthrow of her, whom I eſteeme more pretiousthen mine owne life, and the rather, ſithence I am predeſtinate to be vnhappie.</p>
               <p>Let me I pray you be pardoned in this, becauſe I know my ſelfe euery way vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of ſo rich a curteſie, hauing receiued but too much fauour alreadie at your hands, in that you haue vouchſafed to permit me to enioy your more then Angelicall preſence, thus long and all alone. Neuertheles, I moſt humbly thanke you, as much for the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thereof, as if I had enioyed the ſame, I being euery way contented and ſatisfied, as I would my ſelfe. Thus did I excuſe my ſelfe, as one vnworthie of ſo great a kindneſſe, (making daintie of the matter) when my Ladie, ſeeming as it were (to be angrie, that I refuſed the ſame) and ſomewhat bluſhing through Choller, thus replyed.</p>
               <p>Well ſhepheard, well, I now perceiue that you will not accept of this ſmall fauour, becauſe vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> would haue ſome colour to complaine of mee, after my departure from you. Willingly I offer it, then willinglie accept it: for ſay that anie thing otherwiſe then well, ſhould happen vnto me about this matter, yet would not I haue thee to think I loue thee ſo ill, as I would lay anie blame vpon thee at all. More pleaſing is a hurt come (by chaunce) from a friend, then a pleaſure or good turne done vnto vs, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from an enemie.</p>
               <p>Then if I may doe any thing with thee, let mee intreat thee, to doe as I will haue thee, which if thou wilt not, then wilt thou make me to think thou neuer didſt affect me.</p>
               <p>The refuſall of a gift, preſented in good will, argueth a peruerſe minde of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the giuer, that doeth refuſe the ſame: Euen ſo, I cannot imagine otherwiſe of thee, but that thou rather hateſt mee, then loueſt me truely, and therefore doe as thou pleaſeſt. But I will call the heauens to witneſſe of mine offer, proceeding from a pure good will, to the ende the blame ſhall be thine, and not mine, (if hereaſter without cauſe) thou ſhalt exclaime againſt me.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if euer thou meaneſt that I ſhall remember thy loue, and that I ſhall thinke thou haſt euer affected mee, with a chaſte and an vnſpotted heart, then let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee, to accept of this gift, which as I knowe it will be pleaſing vnto thee, ſo ſhall it be no way hurtfull vnto me at all.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, (ſaid I) louely <hi>Diana,</hi> that ſuch is thy pleaſure, I will obey the ſame whether I liue or die: and not a little will I glorie herein, that I haue liued to fulfill the will of ſo great and gracious a Ladie as your ſelfe: ſwearing by thoſe your Diamond eyes, that what miſchaunce ſo euer ſhall hereafter light vpon mee, I neuer will accuſe you for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, I gentlie tooke her Iuory ſoft hand, which I kiſſed, bedeawing it with many a louing teare. O ſweet thought thereof, ô pleaſing remembrance of that good
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:15406:195"/>Fortune, and ô ſacred memory of that bleſſed time, although they coſt me dearely, not long after. That poore vaſſall who findeth himſelfe puniſhed, for preſuming to haue hunted within the Parkes of his Lord, receiueth not halfe ſo deepe a conceit of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as this Fauour made mee afterwards to endure.</p>
               <p>So much was my delight, as I ſeemed to be rauiſhed therewithall, nothing in the world being able to haue contented mee ſo much, as that did. That thing which a man loueth, and hath a minde vnto, hee thinketh can neuer be too deerly bought: Euen ſo, I found nothing ſo precious in my thoughts, as was thoſe kiſſes, which I then enioyed: Alas, neuer doe I thinke thereof, but that I am ready for to ſownd.</p>
               <p>That wicked Tyrant <hi>Dennis,</hi> beeing driuen out of his kingdome of <hi>Sicile,</hi> neuer thought himſelfe ſo wretched, (when he remembred his vtter ouerthrow) as I doe, when I call to minde my former life and happines.</p>
               <p>I ſtood ſtill as a ſtone, ſighing and crying out, as indeed I had reaſon, for two cauſes eſpecially. The one was the abſence of my Ladie, the other, the loſſe of that ſweete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, which I then enioyed, and was to giue ouer preſently.</p>
               <p>But the day now beginneth to be late, and therefore I will briefly make an ende of this my more then wofull Tragedie.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had I let goe my Ladies hands, but that the whole troupe of Nymphes were arriued, they all ſaluting <hi>Diana</hi> their Gouerneſſe, who was not ſlowe to returne them the like kindnes againe.</p>
               <p>Alas, this was that diſmall day, which did me both good and bad, and all at one time together: wherin I may compare her vnto the Viper, which being venomous, doth ſting deadly, and yet neuertheles, ſerueth for many neceſſary helpes and vſes; For then was it, when my Miſtris, (ſtill ſetled in her firſt reſolution) tooke leaue of all the Nymphes, her companions, to goe and incloſe her ſelfe within ſome ſolitarie Cell, for none could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her from the ſame, althogh with ſighes &amp; teares ſhe was perſwaded to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I poore wretch, being not able to endure to behold ſo pittifull a departure, weeping and crying out, like an other <hi>Niobe,</hi> conueyed my ſelfe behinde a Rocke, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my loſſe at the more leiſure.</p>
               <p>O how heauy were the complaintes I made as then? how dolefull the mournings? how bitter the laments? and how pittifull was the moeſtfull ſound of my dying voice?</p>
               <p>I muſt needs make you acquainted with ſome part of them, becauſe I haue no other delight, then to call to minde theſe my forepaſſed miſeries. Be theſe then (cried I out) the laſt ſpeeches, that euer I ſhall make vnto my deare Miſtris? and thou (moſt glorious Sunne) is it poſſible that I ſhould be able to behold this blacke gloomy day, when thou thy ſelfe haſt hid thy head before times, for leſſe matter then this? If ſo, why then doeſt thou not now hide thy ſelfe? to the ende thou mayeſt not view the moſt wretched Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe that euer liued.</p>
               <p>Who euer knew a bodie to liue without a ſoule, breath, or blood? no more ſhall mine do, for thou holdeſt my ſoule and heart (louely <hi>Diana.</hi>) The cruell Deſtinies ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thee of mee, but of my life alſo. In loſing of thee, I will loſe my ſelfe: neither ſhall mine eyes ſee any more, ſince they cannot behold thy gracious preſence.</p>
               <p>Vnfortunate I, that did not a while ſince go kill my ſelfe, before I was depriued from my chiefeſt ioy, I now liuing to be but a common receptacle for all miſchaunces what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>As poſſible is it for a man to ſupport vpon his ſhoulders, the huge weight of the Heauens, as for mee to beare the abſence of thee my ſacred <hi>Diana.</hi> Since the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my life is gone, what can mine Eyes behold to ſee? ſeeing their Sunne is Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who ſhall giue light vnto mine heart? and how ſhall my hope flouriſh greene, ſince all comforts be quite blaſted and gone?</p>
               <p>How many Louers haue there bene, that haue either dyed with griefe, or elſe haue ſlaine themſelues, with their owne ſwords, onely becauſe they haue loſt their faire Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triffes? What then ſhould let or hinder mee, but that (in like manner) I may followe their examples?</p>
               <p>The Marchant that hath no marchandiſe, ſhutteth vp his ſhoppe, and liueth idlely:

               <p>But chiefly you faire Eyes, muſt I needs bid you Adieu? my two glorious Sunnes, haue you reſolued neuer to ſhine more? and muſt I needs ſtill liue in darkneſſe?</p>

               <p>No ſooner had I engrauen theſe Verſes, but that I got me vp vnto the toppe of the ſame Rock, minding to caſt my ſelfe downe into the ſwelling Seas, when vpon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, an other new conceit came into my braine, which was to ſee, if I could deuiſe a meane, how I might reſtore <hi>Diana</hi> againe, not onely vnto my ſelfe, but alſo vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nymphs, who (as well as I) ſore lamented the loſſe of her departure.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon (I knowing that ſhe would not be perſwaded, by any reaſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, to be reclaimed or altered from her firſt determination) I went and ſought out her Friends and Parents, vnto whome I bewrayed the intention of their faire daughter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them, with all the earneſt ſpeeches I could, &amp; by all the liuely reaſons as might be deuiſed, that they ſhould not in any wiſe permit her, to haue her will therein.</p>
               <p>They hearing mee tell ſo ſtraunge a Tale, were wonderfully amazed and daunted therewith: (For <hi>Diana</hi> neuer meant to haue made them priuie, in this her ſecret buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,) promiſed mee, that they would ſo worke, as they would (if they could) croſſe her in this her reſouled purpoſe, they themſelues being much vnwilling ſhe ſhould take vpon her any ſuch Auſtere and Melancholike courſe.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon, I being glad, that they iumped with mee in opinion, (hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hearty thankes from them, for my kinde Intelligences,) came away wonderfullie well pleaſed, in that I had ſpedde ſo well. And not long after, they tooke ſo good an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the faire Nymph, (although very much againſt her will) was conſtrained to obey their heſts, and giuing ouer her former reſolution, liuing amongſt vs, as ſhee had vſed before.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:15406:197"/>
               <p>But alas, as hee that buildeth goodly houſes, oftentimes erecteth his graue, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chaunce to be ſlaine therein:</p>
               <p>Euen ſo I, thinking to prolong mine owne life, framed mine owne proper death, and ouer throwe. For my Miſtris (who before time) was wont ſtill to vſe mee kindely, ſhewing me good countenance when ſhe ſaw me, (although for the moſt part, ſhee was ſadde and heauy in her minde, becauſe ſhee was barred from her moſt wiſhed for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne) came at the length to know that I onely was the chiefe cauſe that her Parents had ſo much hindered and croſſed her againſt her will.</p>
               <p>As that Maiſter, who bearing great affection vnto one of his ſeruants (particularly) both hateth and deteſteth the ſame man, after he findeth how hee is run-away, and hath robbed him of his goods and Treaſure.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, no ſooner came theſe diſmall newes vnto her cares, but that ſuddainly ſhe began to alter her minde towardes mee, hating mee vnto death; yea, and that in ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell a manner, as ſhee beganne (now) to loath mee, a thouſand times more then euer ſhe had loued me before. Wherevpon ſhee vowed in her minde to be reuenged vpon me, imagining and deuiſing in her ſelfe, how ſhe might beſt doe it. But alas, what need had ſhe, to haue troubled herſelfe ſo much? For ſhee needed no other to execute this ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full malice towards me, then her owne poore ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, how chaungeable and vncertaine, the fortunes of Louers are in their Loues. For one morning, I finding her alone, beganne (as I was wont to ſalute her: when ſhee preſently) looking as redde as any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re, (with extreame choller) began thus to requite my kindneſſe.</p>
               <p>O cruell and vngratefull wretch, out of my ſight, if thou meaneſt that I ſhall liue: Is this the reward for ſo many curteſies as thou haſt receiued at my hands, to ſeeke moſt Traitreouſly to hinder mee in my ſacred and religious intention?</p>
               <p>Away I ſay, and out of my ſight, for I forbid thee my preſence, and thinke (or elſe It ſhall goe hardly with me) but that I will moſt grieuouſly plague thee, for thy vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and leaud dealing.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, I commaund thee vpon paine of death, that thou neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to come (againe) before me; Cruell, vngratefull, falſe-harted, and wicked Creature as thou art, that haſt thus requited mee with euill for good, moſt iniuriouſly oppoſing thy ſelfe againſt my moſt iuſt and godly deſires.</p>
               <p>And hauing ſo ſaid, away ſhe flung, ſwelling for very rage and anger, and not ſo much as (once) ſtaying to heare what anſwere I could make in mine owne defence.</p>
               <p>That woman whom her husband hath taken tardie, as guiltie of ſome hainous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, is not halfe ſo heauie &amp; ſorrowfull, neither ſo confounded with feare and ſhame, as I was then. Long did I ſtand ſtone ſtill, as if my feete had growne vnto the ground, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I able, or had the power, to open or lift vp mine eyes, ſo much had grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeazed vpon me, as I thought verily, I ſhould haue dyed (as then) in that place.</p>
               <p>In the ende, comming vnto my ſelfe againe, and remembring the more then cruell threatnings of my dread Miſtris, without wailing any more, or bethinking me of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuiſe, how to excuſe my ſelfe, I ran vp vnto the toppe of the Rocke, vpon which I had bene ſo often before.</p>
               <p>That done, I cloſed both mine eyes, flinging my ſelfe downe from thence into the maine Sea, reſoluing to drowne me within the bottome of the ſame. No ſooner was I in the water, but I began to repent mee of my raſh enterpriſe, whilſt the feare of death (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not farre off) ſo terrified and affrighted mee, as I beganne to ſwimme moſt luſtily in the waues to ſaue my life.</p>
               <p>Thus as I was tumbled and toſſed too and fro by the churliſh Surges, a certaine Shippe (by great good fortune, ſailed by) the Marriners and Sailers whereof, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with pittie, tooke mee vp by a rope, being verie heauie and ſadde, as you may well ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>And within a while after, whether it were by reaſon the inward griefe I conceiued for my Ladies vnkindneſſe, or becauſe of the great paine and labour which I had taken in ſwimming, I know not, but I fell to be moſt extreamely ſicke in the Shippe, vpon the ſuddaine.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15406:197"/>They doubting leaſt I would die, as thoſe who were very vnwilling to haue any diſeaſed folks in their veſſell (although forie for the ſame) yet forced, and as it were halfe againſt their wills, ſet me on land in this deſart, leauing me ſome victualls to liue vpon, vntill better foretune ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>In the end I recouered my health againe, and am miſerable <hi>ARCAS,</hi> confined to fiue in this comfortleſſe wilderneſſe, and depriued the company of my deare Miſtris for euer: my comfort is, that my dayes will ſoone be ſhortned, and that I haue not long to liue. And thus (good Father) haue you heard the true &amp; dolefull diſcourſe of my more, then wretched misfortunes, which will neuer end, vntill my life ſhall part, from this his vnwelcome manſion.</p>
               <p>I doubt I haue troubled you, in being ouer long, but (alas) it was ſore againſt my will, for ſooner (if I could) would I haue ſiniſht the ſame.</p>
               <p>Not a whit, (anſwered the olde <hi>Magitian,</hi>) for you rather haue pleaſed mee very much, and I like your diſcourſe maruailous well. And God (I pray) comfort you, for great need haue you thereof. But it is (now very neere night;) Let vs then goe (replied the Shepheard) ſeeing I haue (now) ſet downe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the reſtleſſe liues, the pittifull complaints, and the moſt lamentable kindes of ſuch as haue loued.</p>
